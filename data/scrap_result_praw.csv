My contractor coworker quit with 10 seconds notice after what our manager said about contractors,"I worked an engineering contract for a while.  They were pretty open ended, like a lot were, with a vague (but not binding) length specified.

Kind of like:  ""This contract is expected to be for 12 months, but it is at will of the employer, and could end earlier or be extended further.""   But for those that do that kind of work, *usually* they stick to the vague timelines, and a lot of well performing contractors get extended.

Anyway... one day our team of 10 (all contractors, managed by one full time employee) let 3 of the contractors go.  (And they had ME do it!!! Technically I was running that team, but... I was a contractor too, and not in charge of any firing like that.)  So they were told ""this is your last day"" at 4pm.

Me and another contractor asked our sponsor ""hey - how come we didn't give those guys any notice?""

He said brightly **""that's why we hire contractors! So we can cut them loose at a moments notice whenever we want to!""**

We didn't love that answer.  Also - it was a weird thing to say to two other contractors...  He basically told us we'd get no notice and be let go instantly someday.

Anyway, long story short, that other contractor was a VERY sharp guy.  He started interviewing, and got another job.  He told me about it (and I didn't tell anyone else).  It started in a few weeks.  He just kept right on working the contract job, and was right in the middle of a bunch of work that only he understood.  

At 5pm on his last day he just stood up, grabbed his laptop/mouse/docking-station, walked to our sponsors desk and set them down.  He just said brightly ""hey, thanks for everything, this is my last day!"" The guy said ""wait, you're leaving?"" and he just said ""yes, thanks!"" and walked out.   That was it.  

(He did also hit 'send' on a more official 'last day' email at the same time too.)

It was really funny, his work was half done, he didn't answer any calls or questions about it, and it took us like a month to figure it all out and get that project back on track.  If the sponsor hadn't been SO delighted about being able to fire contractors at any second, that guy would definitely have given a nice two week notice and worked to have a smooth handoff of his work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nm1iyy/my_contractor_coworker_quit_with_10_seconds/,0.9859,0.09102698403677624
Abandon your kid on the road as a punishment? Well now they‚Äôre getting a free pony ride,"I feel like this is pretty minor petty revenge but it was such a wtf situation I wanted to share somewhere. TLDR at bottom.

So I work on a farm and keep my horse there. This morning, my bf and I went for a ‚Äútrail‚Äù ride down the road, I kinda need to give some info as to how this road is laid out. The road is on an incline as it goes up the mountain; there are some activity places up the road from the farm as well. There‚Äôs no sidewalk along the road and there‚Äôs minimal space off to the side of the road. When we hear or see cars coming, we pull into a driveway or larger pull off areas and wait for them to pass before continuing. Not super safe or ideal for horses or walkers, but beggars can‚Äôt be choosers, and cars are usually moving slowly on this road. There are some slightly more blind curves though and on occasion, a car moving way faster than it should.

At this point we are on our way back to the farm, moving up the inclined road. We hear a car coming up the road so I pull into a driveway, and my bf farther behind me, pulls off to the side. After a while, a van passes by me with a side door open. I turn to my bf and say ‚Äúthat was weird, their door was open‚Äù he looks behind us and says ‚Äúhey, I think we should go back, I think someone or a kid is walking on the road. We should make sure they‚Äôre ok, I thought I heard someone yell ‚ÄúWALK.‚Äù‚Äù

I agree and as we come back over the edge of this hill, sure enough, there‚Äôs a kid between 10-13yo walking on the road with his phone in hand and crying. My bf asks if he‚Äôs ok and he says yeah but that‚Äôs obviously not true. I connect the dots and ask if his parents kicked him out of the car, he says yeah. I‚Äôm pretty shocked at this point and ask if he knows where they were going, and he names one of the activity places about 1/4 mile up the inclined road. I‚Äôm pissed at this point because who tf abandons their kid on an unfamiliar road, in an unfamiliar state (he told me his fam was on vacation here), as a punishment?! Let alone a road that doesn‚Äôt even have a sidewalk!

Between the dangers of him walking up this road alone and the distance to get to the activity place, I knew there was no way I was just gonna walk away. I also didn‚Äôt want to make him follow us on foot the rest of the way to the farm. We walked to driveway and I dismounted then called him over and gave him my helmet. I told him I was gonna put him on my horse and I‚Äôd walk her with my bf following on his horse back to the farm. From there I‚Äôd drive him in my car the rest of the way up the road to the activity place.

He perked up as he rode my mare and I tried to get more info from him. He said he was afraid to do the activity (it involved heights, so valid) and he was talking back to his dad and asking ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. His dad got pissed off and was yelling, and kicked him out of the car. He said his parents are really strict and I didn‚Äôt wanna keep asking questions because every time I did he would get visibly upset.

As we neared the farm his phone rang and it was his mom, the convo went like this:

Mom: where are you?

Kid: on the road, this nice lady let me ride her horse-

Mom: what did you tell her?

Kid: that I got kicked out of the car

Mom: did you tell her why? Did you tell her you were being disrespectful?

Kid: yes

I ask if he wants me to talk to his mom and he immediately says yes. I say hello and say that I put him on my horse so he wouldn‚Äôt have to walk far and we are almost back to the farm and then I can drive him up the rest of the way. She says she‚Äôs coming to get him and asks where we are and I say on the road. She says ok thanks I‚Äôll be there soon and quickly hangs up.

About 5min later she shows up and I help the kid down. Mom looks irritated, says thanks and tells him to get in the car. then the following convo between me and her.

Me: you‚Äôre welcome, but it‚Äôs really not ok to just kick your kid out on the road like that.

Mom: He was being disrespectful and taking back to his dad and cursing at him!

Me: that doesn‚Äôt make it ok to leave your kid on the side of the road. You‚Äôre lucky we were the ones who helped him and not a bad person.

Mom: you should tell that to his father! (Who isn‚Äôt with her btw) his father had enough and couldn‚Äôt take it anymore!

Me: well it sounds like you don‚Äôt have a son problem, you have a husband problem!

Mom: *huffs* tell me about it!

I just let her leave after that. It sounded to me like she didn‚Äôt agree with kicking the kid out (in which case she should‚Äôve gotten out with the kid), and that they probably argued over it. Her tone made it seem like this wasn‚Äôt the first issue she‚Äôs had with her husband. I didn‚Äôt want to push it, for all I knew he was abusive to her and/or the kids and berating her wouldn‚Äôt have made things any better for anyone. I just hope he didn‚Äôt get more punishment afterwards for not walking all the way. Whether he really was being a PITA kid or the parents were just overreacting didn‚Äôt matter to me, you don‚Äôt abandon your kid like that as a punishment.

My petty revenge was that instead of a punishment, he got a pony ride. Plus, anytime he tells the story about the first time he rode a horse, whoever‚Äôs listening will find out it happened because his crappy parents abandoned him in an unfamiliar place.

Kid, I hope you‚Äôre ok and that I was able to cheer you up in a bad moment. I also hope your mom divorces dad, gets full custody, and he has to pay child support.

TLDR; child was kicked out of their car and forced to walk on an unsafe road in an unfamiliar place as a punishment. Instead of getting punished, I gave him a ride on my horse.

To the doordasher who stood and STARED at me the entire time I made your pickup order:,"I do apologize for whoever was waiting on their order but your doordash driver sincerely sucks. It was 7:15am when they came in, I asked for the name on the order (alex) and I told him I was just finishing up a previous online order, but his would be ready in a few minutes if he wanted to take a seat. Nope. The driver just stayed at the end of the counter and stared, FULLY. FUCKING. STARED at me the entire time I made the smoothies. What did I do? I went slower. I did not rush, I took my damn time.

I am fast making smoothies and putting the order all together but this driver really pissed me off by being completely quiet, minus a few huffs, and just glared at me the entire time. Like bro, I am making the order, please stop, I‚Äôm uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt need to be eagle-eyed watched!

toilet revenge,"Years ago I worked cleaning houses. I had one set of clients who were pretty spoiled and arrogant. The day before I came in I talked to a friend of mine who had worked long hours as a supervisor on salary in that couple's factory for maybe 15 years. He worked his butt off. He is a minority and so they paid him as little as they possibly could. He had known them for a very long time- before it was obvious they were rich, and was one of their first employees. When I talked to him he mentioned he had gotten laid off with little notice and they were trying to put it off as a firing in order to not have to pay his unemployment. I was pissed, I knew how hard he worked. I knew how loyal he was to them.

I got to the house that morning and the couple was not there. But their live in Au Pair was. An Au Pair is a child carer, sometimes cook and errand runner. She takes care of all appointments, packing lunches, driving to soccer games etc etc. The Au Pair was crying and I asked her why. She said these people do not care about me at all. I do the best I possibly can for them every day and have an emotional investment in these kids and they are just rude and dismissive. It's all about them. I forget what the last straw was- I think they wouldn't allow her to visit her mother on her birthday or something. Some sort of feudalistic insult.. Anyway- something on that level. I suggested she quit, and she did. I could hear the woman yelling at her later and the Au Pair left the house crying.

Before that, when the woman got home she told me not to use one of the bathrooms as the toilet was clogging and overflowing. The plumber would not be able to make it out for another day or 2.

I cleaned the entire house, waited until I got paid cash and she left the room and then I took a shit in that toilet and flushed it. It went all over the floor. So absolutely satisfying and gross. It was glorious. She chased me to my car demanding I come back and clean it up and I just said ""I am DONE!! This is not my problem. Clean it yourself"" and left.

When I got home my room mates told me she had been calling them non-stop and yelling at them and simultaneously telling them I needed to come back and clean it and that I should never go there again. Total melt down. I told them about my friend who was also their good friend and the Au Pair. A couple of my room mates had also worked for them in the past.  They they started teasing her over the phone when she called. We all got a good laugh out of that one.

Be nice to your loyal employees, even the ones who wouldn't ever dream of causing you any problems. The others might.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nm5jjm/toilet_revenge/,0.9556,0.08326128747922218
Let‚Äôs see how long the honeymoon lasts‚Ä¶,"Very gently petty, but a good story.

This is my dad‚Äôs (‚ÄúDave‚Äù) story that happened when he was a newlywed (no, I wasn‚Äôt even thought of yet). Dad always had really soft teeth courtesy of poor nutrition during the Depression so dental work was a fact of his life. Very soon after coming back to work after the honeymoon, he had to get some dental stuff done, which was going to take awhile‚Ä¶think multiple dentist visits. 

Anyway, Mom (‚ÄúSue‚Äù) always packed Dad‚Äôs lunches because he left their apartment so early in the morning and she didn‚Äôt have to leave for work until much later. Now, because of the dental work, Dad couldn‚Äôt just bite into a whole apple and had to have the skins removed so they wouldn‚Äôt get caught in the works, which Mom happily did for him.

Now Dad was a master tradesman in a highly skilled trade (which one isn‚Äôt important), and he worked with a bunch of loudmouth jokesters. They‚Äôd been ragging on Dad because he was a newlywed and they just wouldn‚Äôt let up. Everyday it was another set of comments. So, when Dad comes in with a peeled, cored, and sliced up apple for lunch, the comments just got worse. The one that really got Dad (don‚Äôt know why this was the one that really pissed him off, but) was on the order of ‚ÄúWhoa! Look what Dave brought today! A PEELED and SLICED apple! Boy oh boy, you can tell Dave‚Äôs still on his honeymoon if his wife‚Äôs doing THAT for him!‚Äù This was accompanied by gales of laughter from this jerk.

Well, Dad comes home and tells Mom what‚Äôs going on and says ‚ÄúSue, you know how you‚Äôve been peeling and slicing my apples so I can eat them while the dental work is going on? Well, these guys have been really yanking my chain about being a newlywed and thinking you‚Äôre doing this for me because of that.  I want to wipe the smirk off his [Jerk‚Äôs] face. I‚Äôd really appreciate it that for as long as I work there, could you keep that up?‚Äù

Mom, being a badass herself, was really happy to stick it to this guy. Every day for two years (until Dad got a new job), when she packed an apple for Dad it was always peeled, cored, and sliced. And the jerk? Well as you can figure out, the comments got less and less as time wore on and finally stopped. On Dad‚Äôs last day there, he made sure to have his usual cored/peeled/sliced apple. Lunchtime rolls around and he turned to the jerk, looked him dead in the eye, took a bite of the apple, and said ‚ÄúWell, I guess my honeymoon never ended, huh?‚Äù

Jerk bent his head, looking at the floor, while everyone else started laughing at *him* for a change.

Revenge in the Drivethru,"When I was a teenager (circa 1988) I worked at a local McDonald's and regularly worked in the drive thru. Cell phones were pretty new, few people had them, and they were bricks. Despite being new, people had already figured out how to be rude when using them. Some guy in a convertible pulled up to the speaker and I could hear him talking on his cellphone, so I waited a few seconds before saying anything. Before I could ask, he rattled off his order and pulled forward to the window. When he got up to the window, still on the phone and holding his money out the window, I just stood there until he acknowledged me. I asked him if he ordered and listed off the order of the person behind him. He said no. I asked him what he ordered and he repeated his order. I pretended to check the screens and then told him we didn't have such an order. He said he ordered at the speaker. I asked him, in my best customer service voice, did anyone acknowledge him, repeat his order, or tell him to pull forward and he said no. I informed him that we didn't have his order and since the next order had already been pulled up on the computer that I couldn't take his order at the window. (I absolutely could have sent the next order back and taken it at the window or could have rung it up on the front line register, but rudeness and dismissiveness should not be rewarded.) I then informed him that he would have to go back around and get back in line to make his order. In the meantime the line had grown around the building, but he did just that and waited patiently at the speaker for me to ask for his order the second time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nlftur/revenge_in_the_drivethru/,-0.6114,0.08991016966198827
Jerk Tenant?  Let's see about that.,"Years ago I had a recently divorced, single mom move into a rental property.  She was a little high maintenance, as she'd been used to having a husband available for every single house-related thing, but I lived close by and it wasn't over the top...yet.

One night after ten pm I got a call.  The light that lit the sidewalk from the detached garage to the kitchen had gone out.  She demanded I come over and replace the bulb.  Right that moment.

When I refused and instead pointed out that light bulb replacements were lessees' responsibility, she got snippy and said, ""Well, if I fall down I'll just have to sue you,"" and hung up.  I have a visceral reaction to threats--especially for one about litigation.

I had that house listed for sale the next day.  The sign was up by Noon and it sold in 11 days.  (I may have underpriced it, but we still got a lovely ROI.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nleu2l/jerk_tenant_lets_see_about_that/,0.1901,0.13072523949917764
Dryer sheet revenge,"I admit, this is stupid. And petty. I have a neighbor that has very particular feelings about things. In our case, the most significant thing is a hatred of leaves. She will use her leafblower for \*several hours\* each day when the weather is dry. This is not an exaggeration. Leaves from my trees that blow into her yard are promptly addressed (she will try to blow them back under the fence).  

She will also stand under her trees and try to blow the leaves OFF of them and OVER the fence into my yard. It's weird. I think she believes it payback. The only time we interact is when either she sends her husband over to complain to us about leaves or she complains herself. 

I recently learned from a mutual acquaintance that she has a thing about dryer sheets. (she's ""very sensitive to smells"".) I personally don't like them because of their environmental impacts, but having this information has made me not only go out and buy a jumbo pack of very fragrant dryer sheets, but I smile every time I use one now. She has finally brought me happiness after all these years.

Climb the tree so you can peek into my apartment???,"The fake AI story where the guy mentioned honey and birdseed on someone's truck reminded me of something I did back in the 90's.

I'd moved to Winter Park, Florida for college and was living in an apartment with a tree directly behind that completely blocked my view of everything else...but also completely blocked the sun, keeping my apartment much cooler.  Since the tree completely blocked my view (and everyone elses), I didn't worry about walking around scantily clad.  One day, I was making out with a guy (kissing...nothing more than that) when I heard laughing and giggling.  You can imagine my shock and horror to discover several kids that had climbed the tree who were looking in.

After yelling at them and the little b\*\*\*ards running off, I went to the office.  While there was a 'No Climbing Trees' rule, they said there wasn't much of a playground for the kids to play at, and they couldn't do anything to stop the kids from climbing the tree.

After the kids climbed that tree a couple more times, I had an idea.  
  
I went to the grocery  store and bought two tubs of vegetable oil,  two pairs of dishwashing gloves, a container of honey, and a bag of sugar.  The guy who was there when this happened was 6'+ tall...so I called and asked him for help.

After dark, we went outside and thoroughly greased the tree around the trunk and the branches as high up as he could reach.  I also sprinkled sugar around the tree and put honey around the base of the tree....to attract fire ants.

I could tell by footprints in the ground that the kids tried to jump up to grab branches, but having greased the branches as far as the guy in question could reach...they had no luck, and I never had to worry about kids peeping in again for the rest of the time I lived there.

A lifelong payback,"Back in the early eighties, when I was but a young buck. My father insisted on myself and my siblings attending his church.

When I was around thirteen, hitting puberty and upset at the world. I despised having to go to Sunday school. I mean really, being 13 and having to spend an entire hour coloring pictures of Jesus, etc.. kinda pissed me off.

One Sunday, I asked my father if I could stay for the rest of the service instead of having to attend the dreaded, Sunday School class. I was done with crayons damnit.

My dad said No, I was pissed! To say the least. 

Sunday school started after church announcements. Once the announcements were done, the kids would leave and go upstairs to the school. 

Well, sitting there and hearing the announcements whilst pissed, about what I, thought a coherent argument of, ya know,  not wanting to color pictures of Jesus for the next hour, I heard a new one. The church was looking for Ushers. There was a sign up table on the way out. This was/is a lifelong commitment.

So as the kids were asked to leave for Sunday School, I family asked my father again if I could just stay with him instead. He emphatically said no and shooed me away.

So, I calmly walked up to sign up counter right by the door, turned and looked towards him. He wasn't paying attention, didn't matter. I signed him up to be an usher. We had the same two first initials and last name. I 'd forged his signature a couple times, teenage school issues, so I had a relatively good copy. 

Two weeks later when he got the notice that he was supposed to usher, he was pissed. He couldn't say, my son signed me up, I can/won't do this. He had to save face. He had been attending this place since 1933 except for when in college or overseas. 

So my dad ended up becoming an usher for the next twenty years, every third Sunday at St. Paul's Episcopal.

I got an ass whooping that today's kids would never understand. Yet till he left the city, he showed up every three weeks to do his duty.

He's 92 now and still reminds me of how I got him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nktf9x/a_lifelong_payback/,-0.9906,0.08340767524800978
Keep waking me up? I‚Äôll get your car impounded,"My housemate constantly wakes me up yapping on the phone at odd hours (well past 11pm) most nights of the week. I‚Äôve spoken to them about this on countless occasions. They also come home at odd hours and start slamming doors, cooking massive meals, etc. They have also gaslighted me on multiple occasions for stealing and damaging my personal belongings and appliances (potentially $1k in damage/loss), and shames me for not being religious (devout Christian).  

Then I found out they‚Äôve had a speeding fine, red light fine, and their car is unregistered/uninsured. They also park over our driveway obstructing it by about 1-2 feet. 

So, I started with reporting them to the local council for the driveway. That‚Äôs a $300 fine. 

Plus the $400 for being uninsured/unregistered that came with the $600 red light fine and the $500 speeding fine, we‚Äôre talking $1800 in fines in the last fortnight. 

Because it was reported to council, it was also passed to the police due to continuing to drive an unregistered/uninsured vehicle, which has resulted in their car being impounded and a further $800 fine for repeat offence

If you fire me then I'll get you fired.,"When I was 22, I worked at a small auto shop under a newly hired supervisor, let‚Äôs call him C. He was quite rude to customers, mostly mistreated employees, and withheld two of my paychecks, daring me to complain. I stayed quiet, thinking I‚Äôd lose my job.

Then I overheard him bragging about rolling back odometers. I started documenting everything: shady titles, fake bills, receipts three months‚Äô worth of evidence. 

Eventually, C fired me without paying what he owed.

I planned reach out to the owner, a decent man who had no idea what was happening. His office was at a different location; however, he would visit the shop mostly to collect the weekly collections. He would treat the staff with complimentary snacks or small-time pizza party, etc.

So, I went straight to the owner. I handed him a neatly organized folder and told him everything what C did. The owner assured me that I would get my job back, but asked for some time so that he could investigate the matter thoroughly.

Two weeks later, I got a call from the owner, he told me come down to the shop. He stormed into the shop with few bouncers like folks. The owner contacted most of our customers who were treated rudely, took their feedback and made notes. I was confident enough that the owner had considered my evidences during his investigations.

What happened to C? Folks grabbed his collar, threw him out of the shop. He walked with a puppy face and like dog with tail between his legs.

One of my co-workers replaced him and the shop turned into a genuinely pleasant place to work. We would laughed about that dark chapter for years.

‚ÄúHe did WHAT!?!?‚Äù,"Several years ago, I was waiting in a grocery deli line to pick up some potato wedges for my wife. It wasn‚Äôt a long line; I was 4th or 5th in line & the last person in it. Up walks Some Lady (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll call her) and what I presumed to be her daughter or granddaughter. Anyway, SL keeps trying to ‚Äújump the line‚Äù each time a person was served, and the patient deli worker kept telling her she needed to wait her turn, with SL getting more & more frustrated that she could not just do what she wanted. Guy before me goes, and I hear her telling her daughter/granddaughter ‚ÄúThis is fucking ridiculous. I just want some wedges‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Ä¶this being Petty Revenge, we know exactly what I planned to do upon hearing that‚Ä¶

Finally, we get to my turn, and she tries to jump AGAIN, only this time I pipe up and let her know the end of the line is behind me. She did not like that AT ALL, exclaiming ‚Äúthis is bullshit! It‚Äôs 1st come, 1st serve!‚Äù The worker and I just stared at her until she walks back to her Irritation Area off to the side, and I see there are scant few potato wedges available. So! I tell the worker I‚Äôll need more than what‚Äôs available, and he says they‚Äôll need to drop some more. About a 5 minute wait (it was longer than that, closer to 10 as it turns out). Knowing what the lady wants and that it‚Äôs not there, I say he can help her. They go through the same process, which irritates her further, but says something like ‚ÄúFine! Might as well at this point!‚Äù and steps aside in a huff.

New wedges are brought out, and I see her start to move like she‚Äôs going to jump in front of me, but I remind her I‚Äôm next to order. Deli Guy asks how much I want (usually in pounds), and I quietly say ‚ÄúI want all of the wedges‚Äù. 

‚ÄúAll of them?‚Äù

Pizza pizza! Chaos,"I was 22 and in college when I got hired as the assistant manager at a pizza place. After about three weeks of working there, the manager who hired me suddenly quit.  

Even though I‚Äôd only been there for a short time, I ended up running the store for months until they finally found a new manager. I was a quick learner, so I picked things up fast. They even offered me the manager job, but being in college, I didn‚Äôt want that kind of long term responsibility.  

One day, the new manager showed up‚Ä¶and she was a piece of work. Straight out of the company training program, she came in and started making sweeping changes, completely ignoring the systems we had in place that actually kept the place running.  

Our pizzas were supposed to be ‚Äúhot and ready,‚Äù which meant we had to prep ahead of time, but she was all about doing things strictly by the book.  

During the week, sales were relatively slow, but even so, when we followed the book, we struggled and customers complained.  

But we made it to Thursday.  

That morning I went over the sales numbers with her, explaining how 65% of the pizzas we sold were on the weekends and how crazy busy it got. I explained how every Friday we made four times as much dough as ‚Äúallowed by the book‚Äù in the morning, how we rearranged the prep tables, pre-folded hundreds of pizza boxes etc. 

Basically, the entire day on Thursday was spent prepping non perishables.  

After we talked, I assumed she was handling it, so I started counting the cash drawers and stock. About 30 minutes later, I noticed the dough maker giving me a wide eyed ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù look. When I walked over, he told me she had instructed him to make only the ‚Äúby the book‚Äù amount of dough for Friday.  

(For context: ‚Äúby the book‚Äù meant we weren‚Äôt allowed to make more than a set number of dough balls or prep more than a set number of pizzas, wings, sauce etc.)

I reemphasized to her that we absolutely had to make more dough, summarizing everything I had already explained. She pushed back, saying we didn‚Äôt need it and went on about food waste etc. I pushed back harder, knowing I was right, until I finally broke it down mathematically. She reluctantly caved, and we made the extra dough. 

Same thing happened with folding the pizzas boxes, she insisted it was a waste of time to prep that many and actually sent the part time person I had scheduled, to do that specific task and a few others, home early. Thankfully I was able to fold a few stacks of pizza boxes before I went home. 

Crisis avoided.  

Now it was Friday morning, time for fresh prep.  

Every time I suggested an amount of prep needed for a particular item, she pushed back. I mean EVERYTHING. From stocking parmesan cheese packets to the amount of wing sauce we made. 

We FINALLY made it to 3pm. I ended up having to compromise on a few prep items for my own sanity and because I knew the night crew could handle them without it slowing them down too much.  

Then it was time to prep the pizzas. 

By 4pm we usually had around 100 pizzas prepped. On weekends, we not only placed the dough onto baking sheets but also sauced, cheesed, and even added pepperoni before refrigerating them. That‚Äôs how busy it got, it was the only way to keep up.  

So at 3pm the prep crew and I started prepping pizzas. She told us to stop. Without stopping, I explained again about our weekend volume‚Ä¶that someone basically had to continue to prep pizzas constantly during the rush because of demand. Basically that what we were about to prep STILL wasn‚Äôt enough. She told me again to stop.  

I didn‚Äôt stop and continued to push back hard, because I knew the night crew would absolutely suffer horribly if we didn‚Äôt prep.  

By 3:30 it had escalated into a heated argument between her and I. She pulled me outside to try to ‚Äúput me in my place,‚Äù but I doubled down. While I was mid-sentence, she turned and walked away. Frustrated, I stayed outside for 15 minutes to regroup.  

When I walked back in and saw it was almost 4pm, I was just pissed off. I knew the night crew was going to be the ones to have to deal the lack of preparedness and also, I couldn‚Äôt stay because I had an assignment due.  

Then, it hit me.  

I went outside and called everyone who was scheduled that night, warning them about the mess they were about to walk into.  

Almost instantly the phone inside started ringing nonstop, and since it was already getting busy, I walked back inside and jumped on a register, so she had to answer. One by one, everyone on night shift called out. She didn‚Äôt say a word to me about it. 

By 4:45p, all three registers had lines out the door. She was running around frantic, trying to call people in, she was calling other stores trying to get employees to come in to our location‚Ä¶ all while trying to make pizzas in a frenzy.

Since she didn‚Äôt mention to me that anything was amiss, I just continued to rapidly take orders for the next 15 minutes or so. 

Without saying a word, at 5pm sharp, I looked her dead in the eye, clocked out and left. 

That was my last day. I went home and never came back.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1njzyjg/pizza_pizza_chaos/,-0.9977,0.05132577312198182
Please only read this with a sense of humor,"My son (4.5 yo) terrorizes me on bath night. He cannot control the splashing and pouring water back into the tub from a high altitude and splashing his sister (2 yo). I like to bathe them separate to mitigate the frustration, but some nights I have to bathe them together so that we can fit it all in on (two working parents, late dinner, play outside before the sun sets, yada yada). 

So on days where he is testing all of my patience, I let him splash away at the end of the bath and close the curtain so water stays in and (here comes the petty) I will dry myself off after getting non consensually drenched with dirty bath water on HIS TOWEL so he has to come out of his bath to a wet towel ha ha ha mom win.

Eat the fucked up pieces then,"I live with my parents and my brother (27). He does not do anything, and refuses to help with house chores. He will legit get angry and yell when asked. My dad and I were cooking burgers for dinner, and I needed to tend to the laundry and cats so my dad reasonably asked my brother to cut the onion, tomatoes and lettuce. 

He didn‚Äôt even do the lettuce lol, I went behind him and did it. He also has a terrible habit of purposely messing up a task so you won‚Äôt ask again. 

Example: 
Cleaned litter box and left bag of poop on the ground 
Doesn‚Äôt put new trash bag in trash can 

Well the tomato and onion were cut into THICK slices. My dad cut new ones, but I put the messed up slices on his burger. If you think they‚Äôre okay for us to eat, why can‚Äôt you?

Start putting your groceries on the belt behind mine while I still have half a cart to unload? I hope you're not in a rush...,"Elderly person at the supermarket pretended not to see that I was still unloading my cart and just started putting her stuff on the belt. I tell her ""excuse me, I'm not done"". She mutters something but doesn't remove her stuff, just pulls it back while the belt is moving. So I proceed to put the rest of my items one by one, slowly spreading them on the belt. The belt keeps moving and she has to keep pulling her items back. I make small talk with the cashier. I pay in cash (usually use card because it's faster, but I guess not today). I take my time bagging my groceries (can't have anything crushed in the bag, now, can I?). I make contact with the impatient elder as I leave and give her a little smile. She's fuming.

I swear, boomers only have two speeds when shopping: snail-pace when they're blocking other people for no reason and lighting-fast when they're ready to be served and they don't happen to be the first in line.

"That's not even your trash, Karen","I was dumpster driving outside a thrift shop. I'm  an artist who works with reclaimed materials, so I'm a semi-regular garbage picker. When I do, it's always bins on public property, and I always leave the site cleaner than when I found it as a way to say thank you.

Many businesses discourage dumpster diving for liability reasons. If I'm asked to leave, I leave. At least 3 thrift shop employees saw me digging through their dumpster, and did not care. I even chatted with one guy, and he helped me out by finding me a box to carry my stuff.

Just as I'm packing up to leave, Karen comes out and says ""you can't put stuff in our dumpster!"" I say ""I'm not,"" and I carry on gathering my things. She starts to go off on me that I'm stealing. She points to a skate I had in my pile and says ""those are skates we could be selling."" It was a single skate that I had found in *someone else's* garbage, and I told her as much. I informed her that my pile contained trash that I had collected from around the neighbourhood. She continued to [falsely] accuse me of stealing, and how the dumpster was on private property...it's not.

She went back inside in a huff. I put a bunch of stuff back in the dumpster...which she technically explicitly told me not to do. But I clean up as I always do, making sure to not leave any trash outside the dumpster.

But before I left, I placed the single skate dead center in front of the dumpster.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ninmm2/thats_not_even_your_trash_karen/,-0.9039,0.11906353887863474
Spaghetti regretti,"I worked at a small Italian joint that served pasta dishes and salads. Nothing too complicated. 

One of our regulars would come in and order a ton of food and eat it in the restaurant. He would also call demanding we cater an event on the same day, starting only a few hours from the time he called. The manager was a pushover and the guy was always accommodated. 

About three hours before an event, he called and placed a massive order for several dishes, including our new spaghetti made with pancetta. The item was on the menu and clearly stated the ingredients. 

Turns out the guy was massively allergic to pork and ate enough of the spaghetti to get him quite sick. He did not know what pancetta was, apparently.

The next time he visited, he absolutely blew up about it and wanted a refund and free food and all these other things. The owner was in and absolutely blasted the dude but did not ban him. 

The manager removed the spaghetti bolognese and replaced it with the pancetta spaghetti all to spite this guy. 

We returned to the original spaghetti after about a week because the guy stopped coming in. He never went there again and the pancetta is a special once or twice a year to make sure he doesn't come back. 

Even though I don't work there anymore, I get an email for the weekly specials and usually go once or twice to enjoy the pancetta spaghetti. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nimxke/spaghetti_regretti/,0.8844,0.11840196455884058

The time I pretended to like the same boy as the girl I liked in school (I won),"This is one of those things in my life that always makes me laugh in retrospect, because of how stupid it sounds. I was a menace and needed to be stopped.

This happened years ago during my school days. There was this girl in my class whom I had a slight crush on. Let's call her, Nia.

Nia could be mean and rude and this happened often. I was done with her, I was just over it, but I didn't care too much to get my feelings hurt. We were both toxic and not good for each other. I moved on just like that, but the funniest thing happened a year later when I found out she had a crush on a friend's brother at the time.

***Drumrolls***

Whom I knew had a crush on me.

I wanted to get back at her so bad, that I only started caring about him when I found out she liked him to sabotage and get in the way.

Long story short: 

I won the mind games and ended up becoming friends with him. I eventually told him the truth that I wasn't into him romantically. I expected him to get mad for missing out on the chance to get with her, but he didn't seem to mind. I moved away a few years later, but I hope he is doing good. He was a great sport about the whole thing, but looking back I was the worst.

Edit: The comments reminded me, I should have included some context, which I didn't, and I just want to say, I put the B in LGBTQ+

Towed my ex‚Äôs car,"It took over 6 months of trying to politely ask my emotionally abusive, narcissistic ex to move out of my home. He owed me $2,000 and wasn‚Äôt even attempting to give me his half of the bills, spending what money he did have on various drugs, alcohol, and junk food, and not being able to keep a job for more than a few months. It ended in a blow up (because obviously, he wasn‚Äôt going to have it any other way), where he threatened my life. I made a police report and had to get court papers to have him removed. A few weeks after he left, a mutual friend reached out and said he stayed with them a few nights but went back to his home state, leaving his car parked outside their home. Well a few months pass, he still hadn‚Äôt come back to get his car and his plates expired during that time. Over the weekend I found out he had been talking behind my back and lying about so much more than I had even realized. So I reported his car abandoned and it got towed.

You're going to be a jerk over a parking spot?,"  College parking was a constant battle, especially for those arriving after the early birds like myself. But one day, the desperation reached a new level. As a friend and I walked to our cars, a driver was practically glued to our bumpers, harassing us for our spots. I'm usually a ""live and let live"" kind of guy, but her behavior was infuriating. When I realized my friend was parked nearby, a plan formed. ""Need to be anywhere?"" ""Nope."" ""Me neither."" We tossed our bags in the car and proceeded to have a lengthy conversation, blocking those precious spots. After half an hour of her hovering and fuming, she finally gave up.

Shopping carts,"I went to target yesterday and while I was waiting for a car to pullout so I could park, another car came from the opposite side and stole my damn parking spot. They were only able to take the spot because when they backed out I had to wait because it was coming my way, so as I waited the other car basically just pulled in. I mean literally the parking space was still a far walk anyways so I just moved onto the next spot. The lady that stole my parking spot got out and looked dead me in the eye and she rolls her eyes and throws her hands up like I was the problem. 

Anyways, I found me a parking space farther back and made the walk. When I finished shopping, and came out I noticed the car was still there. You know where she parked? She parked right beside the shopping cart storage area. So my petty butt, decided to barricade her car using the shopping carts. As I finished, I got in the car and I seen her coming out of the store. I should‚Äôve videoed the incident but it was hilarious.

I got petty revenge by unleashing rancid farts on my Karen neighbor,"I'm one of those kind of guys who complained about not having their own Karen story in the past. BIG MISTAKE! Never, and I mean NEVER wish you could actually get to deal with one just for the sake wanting to make a post. Last month I moved out of my studio apartment and into a small condo I bought, and finally got away from my Karen neighbor. I only dealt with her for a few months. But it was a baaad few months!

I'll give the short version in this post. But previous ones have the whole thing. But this Karen singled me out to harass from the day she moved in. The first day she was demanding the password to my wifi. She had a yappy little dog that barked so much, she got threatened with eviction. Karen would also make random noises at night to wake me up, would turn up her TV volume to the max, would have loud intercourse with her boyfriend, and showed up at my door repeatedly to beg for energy drinks, cigarettes, or small cash handouts. I think she knew I wasn't going to give her anything, and just wanted to waste my time. She also spread rumors about me, accused me of stealing her phone, tried to force her way into my apartment, and sent her boyfriend over to pick a fight with me. Then she left smelly garbage bags in front of my door. I just moved them in front of her door. Then she spread Vaseline all over my car. The apartment manager just thought it was funny. Karen also ran up and started coughing and bowing her nose onto me because she'd gotten in trouble with the apartment manager for other things. I was already moving out soon, so I readied to dish out some EXTREMELY petty revenge. And I waited till the perfect time to do it.

By my final week of the lease, I'd pretty much moved all my stuff out. So I didn't even need to be there anymore. But I showed up a couple more times, just for the petty revenge. I have mild lactose intolerancy. And if I have too much dairy, and mix it with other things, like caffeine, spice, or fiber, or all of the above, I have puke-worthy rancid farts. The apartment building didn't provide AC. And Karen had a noisy fan in her window next door because she didn't have an air conditioner, and it was hot outside. Well, after eating all the stuff I knew would make me fart like crazy, I opened the apartment's only window, and took a massive dump with the bathroom door open. I had a fan by the door blowing the smell toward the open window. That rancid smell went right outside, and got sucked up by Karen's window fan. After a few minutes I heard her screaming ""OH MY GOD!"". She started gagging and crying. Once I finished that dump, I took some diarrhea meds to chill out my bowels, cleaned the bathroom, and gamed on my laptop till I thought it was safe to leave.

A few days later I showed up in the middle of the night, and sure enough, I could hear Karen's window fan running. So I did the same thing all over again. Karen started screaming through the wall that she'd puked from the smell, and was calling the cops. I just held in my laughter and stayed silent but deadly. Ok, maybe not so silent, because she said she could hear me farting through the wall. I fully expected police to come knocking. But that didn't happen. I cleaned the bathroom again, sprayed the place down, packed up what little I still had there, and left. Don't know if there was any further fallout from Karen. And I'm sure the smell reached other neighbors too. Yeah, I feel guilty for that. But it was worth it to stink her out after the three months of torment she put me through. I doubt she learned any sort of lesson from it though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ni1ipj/i_got_petty_revenge_by_unleashing_rancid_farts_on/,-0.9938,0.05794953880207642
Spicy pizza,I worked at Pizza Hut way back in the day. We had a very mean and creepy manager.

He would always make us make him a thin crust pepperoni and jalapeno pizza for his lunch/ dinner but wouldn‚Äôt let us have any or make ourselves one without paying like he did. One day I‚Äôd had enough so I make his pizza for him and then added a ton of jalapeno juice to the top of the pizza. We had to run it through the oven extra to get all the juices dried up. You could smell the heat coming off of it. Cut it up put it in the box and took it to the back for him a couple minutes later you can hear him coughing and gasping. He asked what we did to the pizza and we if course denied any wrong doing that was the only pizza he offered to share with us and also the last one he made me make for him. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nhocsx/spicy_pizza/,-0.8506,0.11314562463466428
You mow down my plants?,"Had an adjoining neighbor who was used to mowing the part of my lawn between my driveway and his house. The previous owner, my former landlord, didn't mind, but I did.  I saw him outside and went over to show him that my lawn extended to within three feet of the side of his house on the city planning map. He said he had always cut that grass and thought it was his. I thought we understood each other. so I put some perennials in various spots including that area. including some small lilac runners (they can spread underground by rhizome) from my sister's lawn, and some black-eyed Susan's and echinacea. They were not in bloom yet. He mowed some of them down along with my grass. I confronted him and he still played dumb about the boundary. Homeowners know it's important not to let someone else establish a right of way on your property.

That night I took some sheers and cut the stems of the lovely purple allium flowers they had planted in front of their porch, right in the middle so it would be obvious. I watched from inside my kitchen as he stepped out with a cup of coffee the next morning. I saw him notice his flowers lying cut on the ground. He never said anything and never cut my lawn again.

Edit: I did find an iron rebar marker buried vertically just a couple of inches under the grass from an old survey and showed it to him. A couple of years later I had a professional survey done because I was putting up a fence on the other property boundary, where the neighbors were in the habit of using my driveway as a short cut to the street, sometimes even driving over my lawn to the street. It not only showed I was right about the boundary on one side but that I actually had more land than I thought on the other neighbor's side. Fence now in place there.

Double cheeseburger revenge,"When I used to work at McDonalds, I had this really awful shift leader. We‚Äôll call her Linda (not her real name). Linda made everyone‚Äôs life there a living hell.

Family got revenge posthumously,"I know a family who had a difficult relationship with their mother. She could be cruel with her words, and frequently used favouritism to triangulate her children. She had a particular issue with girls. Her two daughters often bore the brunt of her vitriol.

This had life long impacts on them, their life choices, and self esteem. 

Meanwhile their father was an incredible man, he was kind, funny, and a genuinely lovely human (I don't know how they ended up together either). 

She outlived him by almost 2 decades. 

When he died their children made sure that he was buried with a headstone highlighting their love. 

He was listed with a range of loving superlatives capturing who he was. 

However, when she died and it came time to edit the headstone on their double plot, the responsibility fell to her daughters. 

Therefore the stone reads (names changed):

When we landed in Paris there was a very long walk from the landing gate and customs to our gate. When we finally got to our gate area it was very crowded. My 7 year old nephew at the time needed to sit. He has blade prosthetics and they were getting tight and needed replacing soon. Plus, the air travel makes his legs swell a bit. Anyway, we get to the gate and he needs to sit and we're trying to contain the wild 4 year old too. I approach a women seated between 2 empty seats and ask her politely if she could please move one seat over so the boys could sit together, pointing at my nephews legs telling her he needs to sit. She absolutely refused and I think she thought we would look elsewhere for seats together, but I turned to my sister and sis proceeds to sit one of the boys on each side of her.  The boys were really excited and bouncing all over the place. I ran to the restroom and by the time I got back my sister was seated between the boys. I think it took only about 1 minute for the woman to realize her mistake of sitting between 2 excited little boys. My sister said she left pretty quickly.

Vroom vroom jerks!,"This took place in 2017 but the memory makes me laugh. I had terrible neighbors across the street who liked to sit outside and rev their loud cars and street race on main roads late into the night. It was obnoxious and kept my household awake.

My aunt had a huge Ford F150 and you know what beasts they are. I messaged her about the dickheads who would not stop and she said she would stop it.

Two weeks later she did a muffler and resonator delete and drove into my neighborhood with her engine roaring like a fully grown bass in a chorus of tenors whose voices were still changing. She stopped across their driveway and revved her engine for a solid fifteen minutes. The jerks could not have a conversation or sit in their living room because of the noise.

Let me tell you my aunt was a 5‚Äô11‚Äù butch lady who wore flannel shirts with the sleeves ripped off, jeans and cowboy boots. She wore her hair buzzed and had tattoo sleeves of roses, barbed wire and bulldogs on both arms. All she had to do was stand up out of her truck when the puffed up jerk faces came outside and they deflated at the sight of her HAHAHAHA!!

My aunt waved at me through the window and drove off, engine roaring. The jerks never revved their cars again in that neighborhood. They moved away in 2020 right before COVID hit so they may very well be terrorizing someone else with their noisy cars.

My aunt passed this morning from cancer, so I share this memory of her.

Neighbor pushed too far,"

First time posting, sorry for any format issues.
I moved into a 5-acre property back in 2022. It is within city limits so we have to abide by some of the city bylaws.  Between April of 2022 and the present, my neighbor has called City bylaw, City Police, as well as the land use bylaw on me over 20 times. Four things such as dogs barking, building a fence(pallet fence/not permanent), an 8x14 deck built in the yard, long grass, bringing my work truck home, Etc.... In November last year, the bylaw officers told me to file a harassment claim with the police regarding this. (They came and the neighbor agreed to stop with the phone calls and was given my phone number to negate the constant response from various city departments and so I could rectify any issues more quickly. 

Well, 3 months ago the calls started once again. Rv trailer parking, long grass, and a noise complaint (that was called in when everyone who lives at my house was on vacation and no animals were at the house.)

After 3 years of this, I've had enough, Today I called the city in regards to a few issues I have with the state of his property. I started by looking up the bylaws regarding vehicle storage(We're not allowed to store any vehicle that is not registered or insured, and a permit is required.)
This man has upwards of 40 vehicles illegally stored on his property. 
Next, I saw these shipping containers, 3 of them!!!! Guess what folks, in my city, you need a building permit to place those on your property. (They need to be on a properly built parking pad, including asphalt)
And for the icing on the cake, this man rents said vehicles to movie studios for local filming. He has no business license!!!! So this man now has to remove the vehicles and shipping containers before the end of the month, and has to move all RV/utility trailers onto his paved section of driveway or off the property!

Red Robin Line Cutter,"Just stumbled across this sub and figured I‚Äôd share my petty encounter from a couple years back. My family and I were waiting towards the front of the line to check in at Red Robin while they were opening and there was a queue of about 30 guests or so. Pretty busy, but it could have been worse. As soon as the host appeared to start checking people in, this older lady just walks straight through the line and right past everyone waiting. When she tried to check in I interrupted and told the host this lady just cut in front of the entire patiently waiting line and then asked her how she got in front of us when we‚Äôd been waiting in line for 15 minutes. She tried playing dumb like she had no idea what she just did, but I could tell she was pissed as she had everyone‚Äôs attention by then. So I insisted my family at least be seated first and then they can do whatever with the line cutter. I think she thought nobody would call her out because she was an older female, but as patient as I try to be sometimes, I don‚Äôt tolerate people trying to cut in. As we were waiting for our food, the lady was seated at the table next to us and when she looked up I was glaring across the table directly at her as we were now facing each other. I just that there staring at her without saying a word and she was becoming visibly uncomfortable. As I was staring she got on her phone to find out where the rest of her party was and it turned out she was an hour early because of the time change that morning. I heard it all and just smirked at her until she asked to be moved to another table. I‚Äôm sure she gets away with this shit a lot, but at least not this time.

I was the noisy neighbour,"Many years ago I lived in a semi-detached house in northern scotland just outside of Aberdeen

  
And my neighbour put in numerous complaints that I had been making a lot of noise.

  
And I will admit I had been making a lot of noise

As I was doing my job of running a ship engine which is a REALLY noisy thing

In singapore

  
8000 miles away

  
This job meant I spent about 8 months of the year abroad sailing around the world on merchant ships and my house sat empty. This appeared to have little to no effect on the noise complaints that were submitted to the local council.

  
This one of the signs that my neighbour was a super Karen

She was a nut job

She had even called the police because the children across the road where playing football in their own garden.

She hated children and hated any noise they made

  
Then life took one of those hard turns which resulted in me putting the house on the market.

In Scotland you put your house into a silent auction with sealed bids where it normally goes to the highest bidder.

The key word being normally

There was 3 bids submitted to me for the house all of which where in the same range

The lowest bid came from a lovely single mum

Who had 3 children

2 of which had ADHD

and she was also planning to do a loft conversion which would create a lot of noise and disturbance to the neighbour

  
Yes

  
I sold the house to her despite it costing me a few thousand pounds ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nfa0x1/i_was_the_noisy_neighbour/,-0.8673,0.10058176487224933
Input output pootpoot,"This tale of petty revenge shall be my last. Let's face it, one can only live through so many petty revenges worth telling in almost half a century on this planet and I think three is a pretty good number, all things considered.

It all began in a tiny village in the most rural, backward thinking part of Southern France. The one where the natives call you a foreigner because your parents moved to the area some 15 years ago and still begrudge them the fact that they bought - gasp. Shock. Horror. They'd be grasping at pearls if they knew what pearls are and were not too stingy to buy some. Think ""I'd rather use a piece of string as belt instead of buying a new one"" levels of stinginess - a disused piece of land from a local farmer that dared sell it to ""some outsiders that talk french funny"".

This hideous, scandalous and unforgivable crime was not forgotten and during the decade that followed this unprecedented cataclysmic event that shook the foundation of this very close knit community to its very core (So close in fact that they were more or less - and sometimes unbeknown to them - related by blood. Even god does not know what happens with whom in the hayloft...), my family got to feel the wrath of the village at every possible turn. From disparaging remarks, half-assed attempts at bullying on the schoolyard (nipped in the bud by the schoolteachers) to blatant intimidation by the local hunters association (met in kind by my father and his 44 Magnum), administrative headaches (like the decision to have a communal road go through the middle of our living room - promptly quashed once lawyering up was mentioned), life in Southern France felt like bliss.

It is fair to say that my family had a somehow conflicted relationship with most the natives...

And when the wannabe roadbuilder mayor decided that it was time to propel the village in a new century by having a communal sewage system set up for the ""old village"" (Imagine a picturesque medieval place with narrow, winding roads lined up with sun backed limestone houses. And shit running down the gutter... The ""outsiders"" like us were living in newbuilts outside of the village outfitted with septic tanks. 20th century style. Running water and all), the news was greeted with lukewarm enthusiasm by my family and friends. At first.

The lukewarm enthusiasm quickly turned to outrage because it turns out that, rules for thee not for me, the mayor had decided to pull his own house out of the scheme. Monsieur was to stingy to pay for his share of the cost for the communal works and connection.

So for a couple of years, I had to listen to my father rage about this dirty rotten bastard making our life a living hell while his piss and shit was flowing down the streets unpunished. ""Ah. Someone should teach him a lesson by plugging his shithole with expanding foam."" was the usual sentence my dad would utter when driving past the mayor's house. (To add insult to injury, the shithole in question was a pipe poking down from a stone arch with the precious excrement of the mayor dripping down a few steps carved into the limestone. A wonderful place ruined to save a bit of money at the expense of everybody else.)

After all that, it should  come as no surprise that one of the first trips I took on my moped when I turned 14 was to the hardware store in the next town where I purchased 4 cans of expanding foam.

The next night, my best friend and I sneaked out of our houses and went down to the village on foot. What we did I hope you guessed...

By the time I moved out of the village 6 years later, people were still talking about the morning when the mayor's morning dump overflowed from his clogged toilet and how he slipped on a puddle of piss and shit at his front door while rushing out to see what was the issue. Because why stop at the back when you can also do the front? After the cans had fulfilled their role, we decided that his front door could do with a bit of home made decoration and gave the good man a taste of the medicine he so generously shared with all of us for so many years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1nf5jrn/input_output_pootpoot/,-0.8753,0.06896666759669866
Don‚Äôt want to Answer our request for a walkthrough and key exchange? Then we will leave without letting you know.,"Finding affordable housing where I live is nearly impossible. So when my roommate and I finally managed to secure an apartment through an acquaintance we were thrilled. It felt like a huge relief even though the rent was higher than what we could comfortably afford. Because the rent included utilities and internet we convinced ourselves it was worth it and decided to overlook a few glaring red flags.

It did not take long before the problems started. The first time was when our electricity was cut off not because of us but because our landlord had not paid the bill. We spent five days without power which also meant we lost everything in the fridge. Legally this meant we were not required to pay rent for those days but when we pointed this out our landlord flat out refused to reimburse us. Taking him to court would have cost more time and money than simply letting it go.

Then it happened again. The heating was cut in November. After that the internet began getting cut every other month. Eventually we just started paying the internet provider directly just to ensure we had a stable connection.

Through all of this we never once failed to pay our rent on time. The problem was our landlord. He simply was not passing it on.

The final straw came when the police showed up at our apartment with a search warrant in his name. They searched the entire place even barging in on me while I was in the shower. That was the moment we knew we had to leave. In truth we had decided long before to move out but finding a new place in this market was incredibly difficult.

We did give him notice, we sent a text with our departure date requested a walkthrough and asked about exchanging the keys and deposit. We also mailed a formal letter to his legally registered address (yes this is an actual thing in Germany) though of course his registered address was our apartment. In the letter we included documentation of the utility cuts and the police search as grounds for breaking the contract.

He never responded. Not to our text. Not to our mail. No call. Nothing. He ghosted us.

We already that we would never see our deposit , he‚Äôs clearly not great with money. So we left, no rotting food in the fridge and no shrimp in a lamp but we didn‚Äôt bother to clean up either . 

But here is where the petty revenge kicks in. After months of being ignored after being left without heat,  power and internet and after the drama of the police walking through our place we walked away. And now he is the one desperately texting us daily begging to know if we are going to pay rent pleading for us to respond asking if we could scan his important mail that is still arriving at our old address.

Driving on the wrong side of the street,"As I‚Äôm coming up to an intersection and turn right in my fairly large cargobike, I‚Äôm met by the front of a Tesla who thought that one way for cars also applied for bicycles. 

She must have been in a hurry because she tried to get all the way up to the line despite a group of about five cyclists waiting for the green light in front of her.

Unfortunately for her this particular street is a bicycle street with cars being allowed to drive in one direction. She‚Äôs left barely enough room between her car and the sidewalk for a normal bike to shimmy past, but my cargo bike is about a meter wide.

So anyway I stop right in front of her, and tell her to get the fuck out of my way.

She somehow feels entitled enough to have the audacity to tell me to back up, I tell her to kick rocks and back up and stay in her own lane. Finally she backs up about a meter, not enough to actually drive around me so I just move my bike forward and tell her to go back to her own lane. (This is where I wish I‚Äôd remembered my favorite insult to drivers, asking if they‚Äôve gotten their drivers license at Legoland).

Finally she gives up and backs up enough that I don‚Äôt have to move around her, gives me the finger which I happily reciprocate and go about my day.

What drives my up the wall is, when school's out, (grand)parents sometimes park in front of my drive way.
So I come home from work and there is someone parked (still sitting in the car) in front of the driveway. 
Now I'm tired, had a bad day and kinda done with this BS. So I signal the guy to please move. He gives me the standard ""it's just 5min to pick up the kids"" routine. So I cut off my engine, blocking the entire street. 
People start honking until the traffic cop (who regulates the traffic and the start and end of school) comes over. He asks why I'm stopped and I answer. Oh, it's no big deal. This guy is just parked in front if my driveway for 5 minutes to pick up his kids. 
Cop goes over to the other guy and ends up giving him a ticket.

Excuse me,"A few decades ago I was studying engineering in college. That meant engineering books which are generally large and hardback. That means my backpack could approach 20 pounds on a bad day. This was a heavy pack day.

One of my classes was in an old building where the classrooms were not well designed. The class of about 50 students had one 36 inch wide door to exit which meant single file as we all had large packs full of books. The process was slow at best. It was like a large sink with a small drain.

The door opened into a wide hallway where the next class waited to enter. Sometimes people from the next class would try to enter  while the last class was exiting. Not ideal but can be done if people are aware and limit their time in the doorway.

One day there was a guy standing in the doorway talking to a friend. He could have taken a step back and to the side or forward and to the side and not impeded flow. Nope, junior had to stand in that spot and make people squeeze past him. I decided to open the drain, remove the clog, flush the turd.

I slung my book bag on my right shoulder, walked quickly towards the door and as I entered the doorway turned sideways, so I could pass thru, and said ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù. My body could fit the gap he left in the doorway, book bag could not. My book bag swung around my body and caught him full in the chest. He was knocked out of doorway and speechless as he didn‚Äôt expect the hit, nor was it obvious that I had planned it.

I kept walking and a friend from class caught up to me. He was laughing as he was behind me and had a front row seat. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ndhhlt/excuse_me/,0.9513,0.09289870730115644
Don‚Äôt want me walking on your lawn? Don‚Äôt leave your garbage can blocking the sidewalk.,"Here‚Äôs something small and petty I do when on my daily walk around the neighborhood. You‚Äôre supposed to put your trash by the curb once a week on garbage pickup day. Since everyone in my neighborhood uses different trash collection companies, every day of the work week, there are multiple garbage toters by the curb.

I had a recent injury to my knee that required walking with a cane. No company specifies that garbage toters can‚Äôt be in the middle of the sidewalk. It was annoying and really an inconvenience to step into the street to go around them when I was using a cane.

I started walking around them by stepping on people‚Äôs lawns, not destroying landscape, but walking a step or two on their property. People in my neighborhood get very upset when children or anyone else walks on their grass. No one‚Äôs ever challenged me, but I still feel an ounce of satisfaction by doing this when the sidewalk is completely blocked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1ndm8kx/dont_want_me_walking_on_your_lawn_dont_leave_your/,-0.8676,0.1405605442419574
Money+Power=Karen,"I just started a new job: concierge/security for a high-rise condominium downtown. The HOA president is an older woman who makes it HARD to keep a straight face. She will wait until tenants leave the lobby to talk trash about them, only to smile sweetly when they come back inside. She talks trash about my manager in front of me, tenants, friends it doesn‚Äôt matter (so I have a feeling what she says about me when I‚Äôm not around). She talks nonstop about her divorce (years and years ago) in which she caught her husband and best friend sleeping together and how she ‚Äúwon‚Äù because she got all his money in the end. Her dog is a NIGHTMARE, it tries to attack other dogs in the lobby and she will tell the other tenants to control their animal. 

Well, she had me fired after only six shifts because of a computer glitch. Starting on September 1, 24 HD cameras were set up recording high definition video 24 hours a day which means that the computer that these cameras are connected to is getting dumped with 24 hours worth of video data times 24 every day. Personally, I think the computer is beginning to crash because it is not turned off, updated, or given any kind of break now that the building runs 24 hour security. Staff are required to lock the computer screen whenever we leave the terminal in the lobby, and so when I returned from a patrol a couple nights ago and logged back into the computer, all of the Google Chrome tabs that were up had crashed. And the HOA president had a two factor verification process set up for every app on this computer, which means she knows immediately when something‚Äòs going wrong. After helping me get signed back on, she told me ‚Äúnow I‚Äôm not saying this is your fault, but the next time you login you need to use this particular function so that this doesn‚Äôt happen again‚Äù. Several hours later, when I locked the computer screen to do another patrol the same thing happened. Six hours later I received a call from my HR representative letting me know that I would not be returning to my job.

For the last three days, I have been using this person‚Äòs online business to sign them up for every free catalog request I can possibly find.

Parked like an entitled jerk so I ruined his yoga session,"My city has charge ports for electric cars in public lots. I can't install a charger for my car at my apartment building, so I rely on these public chargers for a hybrid car. When the program started, the parking spots had signs that read ""Electric Vehicles Only."" Because if a gas-powered car takes the spot, the charger can't be used as the cords don't go any further.

Most cars blocking the spots could be reported to the police for towing. But certain entitled drivers of electric cars decide that these are their own personal parking spots. They wouldn't actually plug in to charge - they didn't need the free electricity! They just think their car being electric is giving them the equivalent of a handicap placard for a nicer spot. There is no towing them since they obeyed the sign, their car is electric. (And it's always a Tesla.)

One morning I was driving up to a set of the charge ports because my app said one was free. While waiting at the nearby red light, I could see the spot was just taken and the driver was walking away. He wasn't charging his Tesla and I wouldn't be able to charge.

I had no actual recourse to get the guy a ticket or towed like I could with a gas-powered car. So I waited about 20 minutes. Then I called the yoga studio he had walked into, right around the point when I figured his session had safely been going for a little while. I said to the woman picking up,

""A person in your class drives a Black Tesla, plates \_\_\_\_\_\_. There's a tow truck about to hitch up the car for blocking a charging spot. You should really let them know immediately.""

She was immensely grateful like I'd just done this jerk a huge favor.

Shortly after he came barreling out of the studio and around the corner to save his car. It was obviously fine. I took pride knowing I'd not only thrown off his yoga session, but that he was also responsible for interrupting the class for everyone else and that they would all silently judge him. I mean, who wants the license plate of a bad driver read out during yoga?

Sometimes when I need a pick me up, I like thinking about how he went back to do yoga, fuming that someone was screwing with him.

Since then, the city realized these drivers ruin things for everyone and replaced all the signs to say ""Electric Vehicles Only While Charging."" It's not the same joy as ruining yoga, but now I can I can just call the cops and get them ticketed for my petty revenge.

the time I proved my kindergarten teacher wrong.,"So, when I was in kindergarten (the first time), I had this ableist bitch of a teacher. I didn‚Äôt start talking until like a few months before school started, which had a massive impact on my developmental and communication skills. Truly, I was not ready for general education at that point (and was in a special education preschool beforehand), but I digress. 

This teacher, we‚Äôll call her Mrs. S, had me do absolutely nothing. When the other kids would do math or reading, I was given playdoh and coloring sheets. She would tell me all the time that I couldn‚Äôt do what the other kids were doing, that I wasn‚Äôt smart like them, that I was incapable.

I hated this woman and began to resent her more and more each day. 

Towards the end of the school year, we had career day in the kindergarten classes. I dressed up as a teacher (and wore a monocle, I swear I have a photo of this somewhere). Mrs. S asked me what I was and I told her that I‚Äôm a teacher, but not a teacher like her, because I‚Äôm a teacher who will help everyone no matter what.

I then informed her that I will become a teacher one day and I‚Äôll prove her wrong (about being incapable). She said I hope you do, and after that year, I switched schools.

20ish years later, I got my degree in special and general education. I called my old school, figuring she probably didn‚Äôt still teach there and I would never get my perfect revenge‚Ä¶but oh, she did.

When I got her on the phone, I told her who I was and what year I was in her class. She was pleasantly surprised to hear from a former student and even remembered me!

I then told her about how I just graduated, and accepted a position teaching K-2 special education. She was sooo happy for me, and was really glad I ‚Äúproved her wrong.‚Äù

My crazy neighbour,"I have a neighbour who is a general nuisance. She has pronounced to everyone that she is the ""tenant advocate"" but she is the reason for most of the complaints in the building.

She stalks people, confronts them with accusations then tells the building manager it did not happen or she was talking to someone else. But then she calls police and reports that she was attacked by the building manager.

For context, on her social media she says she is a transcended being who can take herself to ""the fifth dimension"" to avoid her many enemies who are attacking her.

She accuses other tenants of doing to her what she's actually doing to them.

Left Group Alone Without Translator,"November 2024 - I went on a trip to Brazil with friends: Natalie, Kylee, and Gabe (Kylee's husband). There was a music festival there that I wanted to visit for years, but never took the opportunity solo because I have more fun in groups and being in a foreign country with thousands of people wasn't the best scenario for my socially awkward self. Anywho, I explained this to Kylee and Natalie and showed them the layout of music artists and they were ecstatic to go. The city is one that is near to my heart as I had studied there for a year and became the first spot where I could be myself and learned to not care what other people think. It's a place with beautiful beaches, views, and my host family. I was excited to introduce this place to my friends and anytime I brought up a place to visit, everyone would say ""Omg, I can't wait to see it in person!"". There was never any hint of going our own ways and we were excited to spend our trip together. 

In the group, I was the only person who spoke Portuguese and asked if there was anything they had interest in visiting. Natalie and Kylee brought up an island they found on Google that was off the coast, among some other things. Due to the island being heavily monitored due to marine preservation, the only way to get there is by fishing boat. I spent days on WhatsApp being the middle man and booking our trip, as the fishermen wouldn't be able to communicate with them in English. Everything was set, we had a date and were ready to go visit on Sunday morning. I sent them all the details in English - this is important later. 

Bare with me, the petty revenge is coming - 

Upon our arrival in Brazil, I offered to translate as needed. When we would go to any place with a menu, Kylee would pull out an app that translated photos. Despite the app, I still offered to translate. During our first day, Kylee made the comment ""I travel internationally all the time. You really just need to use Google Translate. It's not fully accurate, but between that and gestures - everybody understands just fine. You really don't need a translator."" That comment definitely made me feel off, but I shrugged it off and still offered. 

Saturday, we planned to travel out of town so they could visit a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu school (they both have 10 years experience - this is important later) . We would Uber there and back, and split the cost. The plan? Only spend 4 hours max and then go to the last day of our music festival at night. When it was time to go? They didn't want to. I was told I could go back without them, but didn't want to leave my friends in a foreign city, so I declined. 8 hours later, we finally started to head back . During the 2 hour car ride back, I was told they didn't want to go out anymore because they were too tired. I was pretty frustrated with losing half a day, where I chose not to go either as I felt I wouldn't have fun with the mood I was in and the traffic there just wasn't worth it. 

We got back to our BnB and Kylee and Natalie come out wearing jewelery and dresses. I wasn't put off because they're the type to trade clothes a lot and go all out in it. Next thing I know Kylee goes: ""Alright, OP, our Uber is here to take us to dinner. Have fun at the festival!"" I'm immediately confused and remind her I wasn't going. I still have no idea where the confusion was. Again, I got frustrated and expressed it verbally. I told her the communication had been terrible over the past few days and I was over it. They told me where they were going and I could meet up with them. After they left and I got ready, I called my own Uber to the restaurant. The whole time? I was reminded that Google Translate and gestures are all that's needed.

Here's where the petty revenge comes in - 

Sunday morning (4 hours in advance), I realized that the plans we made to eat with my host family and the places to visit weren't going to happen. I needed to put my mental health first and get away for a day and get what I wanted out of the way. I was told they didn't need a translator and they had enough fight training to take care of themselves. I messaged them that I decided to hold off on the island trip as our full trip was nearing a close and I felt that I might not have the opportunity to visit some places. I left to go to the beach and the first text I get is asking all the details. The night before, I received a text in Portuguese confirming all the information, so I forwarded that to them. They asked about the boat info, and I was lucky enough to be able to forward over a second text I received with that info from them in Spanish. 

Kylee, Natalie, and Gabe were all left on their own where they don't speak the language with texts they could decipher in Spanish and Portuguese. Kylee was an expert in gestures and Google translate, so I'm sure she could figure it out? That night, I asked Natalie how the trip was and they said they missed the boat because they didn't realize how far away it was. Guess she missed how to use Google Maps? Maybe not the best revenge, but I felt it was just üòÇ

Don't lie about leaving kids in your car in the Texas heat to get a parking spot,"A few years ago, during COVID, I had the pregnant wife and three kids with me as we stopped to get groceries at HEB. Not an ideal situation to have the entire ""circus"" together for grocery shopping, but I was what it was. 

It's summer, it's Texas, and it's hot. Think 95F in the sun and 135F+ in a car with the windows up.

As we look for a spot in the very busy parking lot, a guy coming down the isle in the other direction cuts in front of us and parks in the ""Expectant Mother or With Children"" parking. Giant Douche. 

We park, a lot, further down the isle and as we're walking towards the store, this guy gets out of his car (car off, windows up) and starts walking in front of us to get to the store. I'm not sure why it took him 5 minutes to get out of his car after being in such a hurry to park, but I figure it's consistent with the narcissistic personality.  I say to him while pushing the stroller, ""Hey, that parking is really for pregnant women and for families with small children."" He says, ""Yes, the . . . the kids are in the car"" in a very dismissive way making it very clear he thought that was an OK thing to say - but I decide to play along with his BS and reply, ""It's too hot for anyone to be left in a car without air conditioning. That's not safe"". We're getting close to the front of the store. He waives me off and says, ""They'll be fine, don't worry about it"". 

I decide he has just warranted some payback as my wife and I are trying to keep two kids (4 yrs. & 2 yrs.) from running in front of cars for 300' further in a very busy parking lot, while pushing another in a stroller, than we would have if he had not taken the space. Almost as if those spaces have a purpose. 

As we enter the store, there is a manager near the front and I approach her and tell her word-for-word what this gentleman said to me and point him out. I tell her I didn't see any kids in the car, but I didn't look closely. I thought someone should know about the exchange.

This grocery store chain ranks just below a religious institution in Texas and they take their community involvement, sports celebrity commercials, PR, and image seriously. They are not going to ignore a possible life-threatening issue. Kids and pets in cars in Texas summers can die in less than 15 minutes. The store typically has a police presence on-site, more for peace-of mind and criminal deterrence than anything else.

If this guy actually did have kids in the car, I have a responsibility to report it. My belief of whether or not what he said was true is, frankly, inconsequential. 

All I had to do was repeat exactly what he said to the right person, and his words would be his own undoing. Manager says, ""Thank you, we will look right into it"" and I decide whatever happens, I've only repeated exactly what he said to me and was honest that I didn't see any kids in the car.

We finish our shopping, about 25 minutes after entering, and as we are walking to our car - Giant Douche is standing next to his car and animatedly speaking to a constable that has very a disapproving look on his face. 

I smile and think to myself, ""He'll be fine, don't worry about it"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1naz1wv/dont_lie_about_leaving_kids_in_your_car_in_the/,0.9206,0.07330301826836977
A heartfelt thank you for ruining my mental health - enjoy your ‚Äòdecorative herpes‚Äô.,"A few years ago I worked for an absolute asshole. I stayed in that job for six years (far longer than I really should have but I kind of needed the job at the time and truly loved what I did). It was a great learning opportunity, as I ended up learning a lot about business above and beyond my original role - I ended up as one of the most senior members of staff (not bragging- this was a small business so in reality what this meant was more work and responsibility for pennies more pay). 

Needing this job for some level of financial stability, I did my best to ignore the condescending behaviour, bullying, manipulation, micro-managing, guilt tripping, advantage taking, etc. All from the boss. They were an absolute delight! üôÑ Nevertheless, as I was their most competent and trusted employee there was a terse civility between the two of us - although I‚Äôm sure they did plenty of bitching about me behind my back cos they certainly did about everyone else.

When I finally resigned (much to their annoyance, but I was literally done at this point) I wanted to inconvenience this POS for the way they‚Äôd impacted my mental health. I had to be careful about it though, because taking someone to court over some slight genuinely wasn‚Äôt beyond them - I‚Äôd literally seen them do it.

So I opted for the pettiest option I could at the time. I bought a thank you card and wrote a ‚Äòheartfelt‚Äô message thanking the boss for the opportunity, yadda yadda yadda‚Ä¶

Who is going to suspect a thank you card as a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù, right?

Reddit, when I tell you this card was the glitteriest card money could buy I am not joking. Think that super super fine sand-like glitter that spreads everywhere when you just look at it. The entire design on the front of this card was made in glitter, and the residual glitter from the manufacturing line clung to the inside and back of the card. So. Much. Glitter.

On my last day the boss wasn‚Äôt there (because of course they weren‚Äôt üôÑ) so I left the card in their office, said goodbye to all of my colleagues (who I was genuinely going to miss because they were all great people), and left on my merry way, satisfied that the ‚Äòcreative herpes‚Äô that I had left behind on that desk would have the required effect.

I‚Äôve been out of that place for two years, and one of my former colleagues has told me that they‚Äôre still finding glitter about the place. I take great satisfaction knowing that in some stupid, insignificant way I have caused that asshole at least a minor annoyance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1narom1/a_heartfelt_thank_you_for_ruining_my_mental/,0.9958,0.0809240795456295
My disrespectful leech of a internet addict brother shut his room door in my face while I was speaking so I shut the Internet off.,"I pay for the Internet and he pays for nothing in our house. He‚Äôs 26m and he has no job, doesn‚Äôt go to school full time, and has Internet addiction. To top it off my single mother is sick of him saying he‚Äôs gonna graduate from his bachelor program in three years for the past 4 years. He‚Äôs taking a decade to do a 4 year program. He contributes nothing to this house. On top of that he does not answer us when we call him for help or reply when we speak to him half the time. He makes excuses half the time to not eat with us not go anywhere with us not help us when we need help around the house. And worse than this he speaks in a condescending manner to everyone around him because he uses psychobabble to pretend he knows what he‚Äôs talking about and act as if he‚Äôs better than everyone and more knowledgeable. 

I‚Äôm sick of the condescending attitude. 

I was speaking to him and instead of answering me he closed the door of his room. 

So I went into the app that controls the wifi and turned off the connections to his devices. 

He told mom and she started screaming at me about how she‚Äôs losing it because her own kids can‚Äôt get along and if she wasn‚Äôt there we‚Äôd probably murder each other. 

So now he packed his shit up and left the house and will be living with his friend or with my aunt who has always enabled him.

Free Breakfast for a Limited Time This Morning for Loud Hotel Neighbors,"A few weeks ago our family was staying at a hotel resort for a relaxing weekend.  Unfortunately we got roomed underneath a heard of buffalo, or a family of six, I couldn't tell which.  As we put our kids to bed, we ""hushed"" them and reminded them we were in a hotel with other guests, so we could be as courteous as possible.  Not the buffalo family above us.  For hours into the night, until well after midnight, they were banging and slamming things in the room above.  And while I can sleep through almost anything, and the kids were exhausted and asleep, I knew it was steaming my wife.  And that was making me more and more angry - Unhappy wife, unhappy life.

Anyway, we all managed to finally fall asleep.  However my super power is needing little sleep.  I get up every day at 5:00a without an alarm clock.  Sure enough, the next morning a few 4 hours later, I woke up like clockwork, and instantly I had my revenge.  

Going down to the elevator core, I located a house phone and dialled their room: 6 and the room number - the room directly above ours.  It rang five or six times with no answer.  I hung up, and was feeling a little guilty and about to give up, when I remembered I wasn't getting laid today because of these clowns, said ""fuck it"" and rang back again.  This time, a groggy female answered the phone - like barely - ""Heelllllooo???"" she croaked into the phone. 

In my most chipper voice I said ""Good morning! This is the front desk with your morning wakeup call!  Are you awake?""   -- I hear confusion on the other end.

""We have a special thank you gift for families staying with us today - Free breakfast buffet and admission to the waterpark today, however it is first come, first served, and you and your guests must claim your award at the front desk in the next 30 minutes.""  -- more confusion. and I thank her and hang up.

Next I camped out in the lobby to wait and see what happened.  Sure enough about 20 min later, a train of groggy half-dressed family members come down to the front desk, looking annoyed, sleepy and ... did I see hope their eyes?   As soon as they hit the front desk, it got heated - the mom demanding to see the on-duty manager, and the manager trying to explain they didn't call and don't offer that.  It must have taken 5 minutes for them to figure out it was a prank, and sulk back to their room.

I left and went to get some coffee and enjoyed the rest of my morning. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1na01f4/free_breakfast_for_a_limited_time_this_morning/,0.9563,0.0789773562674615
Key?  What key?,"I was a senior in HS in the 1970s and had a summer job at a clothing shop in a mall. It was my second summer working there and I was trusted with closing up the store.  We would always pull the metal gate down to close off the entrance to the store and hide the key in the corner right under the edge of the gate. That way the opening shift person could open up the store as there was only one key to pass back and forth among the staff.  The manager kept his on his key ring. The manager decided to hire his niece Katy and gradually my hours started getting cut down while hers increased.  I finally was down to under 20 hours a week when I had started out full time and I complained. My manager told me if I didn't like it, too bad, I could quit.  So I quit and found another job at another store in the mall.  I was still mad about the situation though.

I bided my time for a few weeks until there came one evening when both Katy and I were working the closing shift at our respective stores.  I puttered around for about 20 minutes until I was certain she had locked up her store and left.  I locked up my store, casually walked past hers and swiftly scooped up her key from its hiding place.  Yep, it was still there!  I threw it in the trash can just outside the entrance doors on my way to my car in the parking lot.  This was the 70s when security cameras were uncommon unless in places like banks and jewelry stores.  No one saw me or what I did.

The next morning I opened up my store and i had the distinct pleasure of seeing my former place of employment stay closed until noon while all the other mall shops were open. Finally the manager made it over and opened up the shop with his one existing key.  Turns out he was out of town and had to come home early to do this!

 He later came over and angrily asked me if I happened to know anything about the missing key.  I got to smile sweetly and say, ""My goodness, No.  Sounds like Katy needs to be more responsible!"" ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n9qba4/key_what_key/,0.9282,0.08163792434979697
How Chuck lost his half of a house.,"Back in the late nineties a buddy of mine, Dan, rented a place from one of our old high-school classmates, Chuck. He'd inherited it from his grandmother and, well, had no interest in living there.

The place was dated. Pink bathrooms, 'Harvest Puke' appliances, lots of dark wood paneling, and a 'conversation pit' in the 'rumpus room'... But Chuck had agreed to rent the place for only $600/month, which made it a total steal. My one bedroom apartment was $425, and this was a 2/2 with a garage and an acre of back yard.

It became the unofficial hang-out spot for five or six months before Dan swapped to night shift.

Then one day Dan calls me at 6am and asks me if I have the home number for a plumber we know socially. 

>Dan: I've been having trouble with things draining and Chuck has been telling me he'll send someone, but now I've got an inch of sewage in the basement, it can't wait, and his answering service isn't picking up.

I pass the number along and I don't hear any more about it. I still see Dan out and about a couple nights a week, he just doesn't mention it and I figure it got handled.

But who does bring it up? Chuck. The first time I see him in months he dashes his ass across the park to catch up with me and bitches about how Dan screwed him by calling the plumber and letting the guy point out a whole bunch of code violations he's gotta fix.

Except, apparently, Chuck doesn't actually fix any of them. No, what he does is pretend he's not getting rent from Dan, and files for eviction. 

Once again, I hear that bit first not from Dan, but from Chuck, who saw me walk in to the grocery store and left his place in line to come gossip about how Dan is going to be homeless and broke really soon for screwing with him.

I'm not real sure on what Chuck's telling me, what with the fact that I know from experience that code violations aren't something you can elect to not fix, but there are lots of wormy methods for landlords to fuck their tenants, including pretending that rent didn't arrive, so..

That evening I go out of my way to see Dan. I wouldn't have normally gone to the bar on a Tuesday, or any hockey night at all, but I knew he'd be there and I wanted to warn him.

Except nothing I say regarding Chuck or eviction is a surprise. He's smirking for most of it, and chuckling towards the end.

>Dan: Don't worry, dude. I have a pretty good lawyer, and that's all I'm gonna say.

>Me: But....

>Dan: Shaddup already, the Wings game is starting.

A couple of months go by, Dan is back on day shift, and his place has become the unofficial hangout again. It's a bitter cold Saturday in January, so four or five of us are in the 'rumpus room' playing video games when we see Chuck's sister, Elle, wander up to the sliding doors with some paperwork and knock.

Off goes the Mega Deth. We all want to hear what this is about.

>Elle: nosu de mausnai egle da..

I can't really hear her, it's just near-whispered gibberish from where I am. She's always been soft-spoken, and seems to be especially so today. But I can hear Dan just fine.

>Dan: Really? That's good. Which one do I have to sign, wait, this one? And do you have a..

>Elle, producing a pen and pointing: .......

Dan scribbles.

>Dan: And the eviction?

>Elle, shuffling papers and handing Dan some: .......

>Dan: Fantastic. Why don't you come in and have some coffee? We're playing Quake, if you want to join us.

>Elle: .......

>Dan: Yeah, I understand. 

Dan boops her nose, complete with a 'honk'. Elle laughs and walks out towards the driveway.

I didn't know what to say, especially with that.. Whatever it was, with the nose.

>Dan: So, I'm sure all you have heard that Chuck tried to evict me. Chuck lost, had to pay me more than his half of the house was worth to make me go away, and, uh, Elle is my new landlord.

Murmurs.

>Dan: But she had to get a mortgage to buy him out, so if anyone wants to rent a room, let me know, because I'm sure what I'm paying is about to go up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n91v2a/how_chuck_lost_his_half_of_a_house/,-0.9657,0.06791720732077726
"My roommate keeps bringing visitors over all the time without warning? No problem, I have the solution.","In my youth, I had to share a room countless times. Sometimes I had excellent roommates and other times I didn't, but the worst by far was Mr. Jon (fake name).

Mr. Jon and I shared a room in the '90s, and it was a nightmare to be with him. There wasn't a week when his friends wouldn't come over to play N64, role-play, or argue about comics and manga. I didn't have a problem with that, but they would come at any hour and without warning, and it was exhausting. Talking to Jon was useless, and even less so to the administration, since they were silent. But it was affecting me.

One night, his friends came over without telling me anything. I was already in bed, about to fall asleep. I tolerated it until I had to go to the bathroom and walked past where they were playing (there was no other way to go) dressed only in boxers. I thought everything would be calm when I got back, but in the morning, Jon stopped me and asked me to stop walking around in my underwear. I said I had to go to the bathroom, but he told me to hold it, that I would bother his friends (all men). I counterargued. They came over without warning, but he continued with the argument that he lived there and that they would come whenever he wanted. That gave me an idea.

The next time they came over without warning, I put on tighty whities and started walking around, to the bathroom, to the kitchen, to do my life. Jon looked at me with hatred, but hey! I lived there too. Since he invited his friends over at any time without warning, I could dress however I wanted. This led to more arguments with Jon, but they were in vain; no one gave in.

So, whenever his friends came over unannounced, I'd dress in my underwear or jockstraps and hang around, or we'd start talking about comics. I lived my life.
After a while of seeing me almost naked, they started letting me know when they were coming, and they also cut back on the frequency. When it came to renewing contracts, Jon didn't sign me, and it was the best part. But I stayed in touch with his friends, including a Venom fan, so that was another victory!",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n8r9f2/my_roommate_keeps_bringing_visitors_over_all_the/,0.962,0.09560169542415146
‚ÄúI have no idea who you are.‚Äù At class reunion,"My high school class had our 25th reunion over Labor Day weekend. We hadn‚Äôt managed to put together a reunion since our sparsely attended 5 year. 

We went to a small college prep school, our class had 72 kids, where everybody knew each other and because it was small you could bounce between activities so there weren‚Äôt a lot of cliques.  High school was mostly fine for my best friend John (names changed) and I except for one guy named Tom who wasn‚Äôt so much a bully as much as a just a general dick to the smarter kids in the class. He constantly made jokes at our expense and ‚Äòpranked‚Äò us with things like creating a bunch of fake invites to a fake party at my parent‚Äòs house or starting a rumor that he had seen John kissing a girl who was a lesbian. 

John founded a company in his late 20‚Äòs and has done very very well for himself. He (and to some extent myself) have raised a lot of money for local charity over the years and recently he spearheaded the construction of a STEM center to be jointly run by several area schools including our high school. His name got put on the building. This has given him a pretty public profile and made him somewhat locally famous. (Yes, his parents had some money but he has far outpaced them) His company has a marketing assistant that has helped get his name in the news, including being featured by our high school‚Äôs alumni newsletters and social media. They also mange his social media accounts because he gave up a few years ago due to time and professionalism. All this has nothing to do with ego, he is an awesome guy but knows that his  company‚Äôs profile and revenue has risen with / because of his personal profile.

Tom has, since college, always been kind of a flashy, self promoting grifter / get rich quick guy. Because of social media,  I know he first tried to be a white rapper / DJ in the early 2000‚Äôs then has bounced from car sales, to some Real Estate investing thing that sounded like mortgage fraud (I‚Äôm in construction and RE so I can recognize that crap), to some PE sounding investment group and now has some crypto bro thing going on. Through the years he has heavily promoted himself on social media and even tried to do the whole ‚ÄòPay me to teach you investment strategy‚Äô thing. He even DM‚Äôd me several times with ‚Äòinvestment opportunities‚Äô to which I never responded. 

Fast forward to last weekend. John hosted a part of the reunion at his house/ barn (he has several acres), about 50 alumni plus spouses and a probably 20 kids showed up. John and I, our spouses and a few friends pretty much camped out on chairs on a side patio and mostly didn‚Äôt bother to mingle. We were all drinking and catching up.

Mid evening Tom came over to us to glad hand John. John stayed calm and exchanged general pleasantries but quickly Tom launched into some BS ‚ÄòYou know you have done well but you could make a lot more money in crypto‚Äô. 

John interrupted him with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt catch who you are here with. Is your wife one of our classmates?‚Äù

You could tell Tom was a bit taken back ‚Äú No man! I‚Äôm Tom \_\_\_\_. We were classmates! Don‚Äôt you remember I used to razz you?‚Äù 

John scratched his head and said ‚ÄúNot really. I think I have a pretty good memory of our class but I don‚Äôt remember you at all.‚Äú

Then John got serious while giving a small wave to the event planner (Ashley) nearby ‚ÄúListen, I get approached all the time like this because of my business, I get it, but this is my home and a private event.‚Äù   
Then looking at Ashley  ‚ÄúHey, can you take a moment to verify the guest list? I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on here. Thanks.‚Äù

Ashley then addressed Tom while giving him a big fake smile ‚ÄùRight this way sir. We just need to just verify your ID against the guest list. I‚Äôm sorry, I hope you understand.‚Äú

Tom followed her off in a bit of a huff.

John sat back down while giving me a wink and then said to the group ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfortunate, I have to be careful.‚Äú

Someone else piped up ‚ÄúYeah that was Tom, he was in our class.‚Äù 

John kinda shrugged and said ‚ÄúHuh, must not have interacted with him much.‚Äú then changed the subject

20 or so minutes later Tom returned with a classmate who had largely organized the weekend and had been friends with him in HS. She said ‚ÄúI hear you said you don‚Äôt remember Tom. He was in our class for all 4 years, he played on the football team.‚Äú

John again shrugged and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sometimes people just fail to leave an impression on me. I hope you enjoy my home and have a lovely weekend.‚Äú At that he turned to his wife and said ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs go check on the important people, make sure the kids a having fun.‚Äú (If you missed this the kids are the important people.) 

John texted me a few minutes later ‚ÄúThat was fun.‚Äù

Revenge on the thieves,"So I used to run a crew for a landscaping company and people love to steal the gas cans off the trucks.

Well, we pack up and head to our next stop only to find our gas cans on the side of the road empty, we pick them up and drive on down the road and find a brand new Cadillac Escalade sitting in the middle of the road dead. We simply waved and went on about our day. This happened quite often but that first time was the best I still remember the look on their faces as we drove past.

Scratch that itch,"I lived in one of a six-pack set of apartments situated in a quiet beachside town, partway between the beach and the local caravan park.

Living so close to the caravan park proved to be far less problematic than I expected it to be with nearly all the residents behaving themselves. Except for the kids. Over the long Christmas holiday season (I am in the southern hemisphere, so it's summer) the kids would eventually notice there was a swimming pool at the rear of our complex and work out they could jump the beach-side brick wall on their way back from the beach in the evenings, have a swim to wash the sand and salt off themselves then leave through the gate to walk down the drive way and arrive back to their caravan refreshed and clean.

This didn't actually bother me too much, because they were usually trying to not draw attention to themselves so were quiet and secretive and by the time they'd discovered the free pool it was nearing the end of the holiday anyway.

Then one year one of the kids mush have been a return visitor because they were into it right from the start and within a week I had kicked them out a couple of times because they were just being noisy and destructive.  
  
But they just got worse.  
  
We lived in the rear most apartment we started noticing our beach towels we'd hang up after a swim started to go missing overnight. Then we made sure we brought them inside in the evenings. Then we actually lost a set of bedsheets one night, and a couple of the other residents were also losing towels. We did find a bunch of towels that looked suspiciously like ours on a communal line at the van park, so it was obvious what was happening.

We're only halfway through the holiday season at this stage, so it was time to nip this in the bud.

First stop, the thrift store and bought some old towels.   
  
Second stop, the local surfboard manufacturer. ""Hey mate, mind if I wipe your fiber-glassing benches and floor down with these towels?"" He did one better, he emptied his fiber glass offcut bin onto them.

Third stop, home, where I hung the towels up on the clothes line.

Two mornings later, I woke up and noticed the towels were no longer on the line. I went for a walk and retrieved four of them scattered along the road to the van park and dumped them in the van park bin to avoid collateral damage.

As expected, no more towels went missing that season. But even better, they either stopped using the pool completely or were at least respectful enough that we never noticed.

Every night she‚Äôd blast music at 1 or 2 a.m., usually when I had an early class. No matter how many times people asked her to turn it down, she‚Äôd laugh it off and say, ‚ÄúRelax, it‚Äôs college.‚Äù

One night before a big exam, I was desperate for sleep. I knocked on her door around midnight and asked politely if she could lower the volume just a little. She smirked, said ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and then cranked it even louder. I laid in bed staring at the ceiling, absolutely fuming.

The next morning, after my exam, I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to let it slide. Sarah was notorious for sleeping in late usually till noon and she hated mornings more than anything. So for the next week, I set my alarm for 6:30 a.m. sharp, right when the hall was dead quiet, and placed my Bluetooth speaker against the thin wall we shared. I blasted the cheesiest pop songs I could find, think bubblegum boy bands from the early 2000s.

The first day she stumbled out of her room, groggy and furious. By day three, she started begging me to stop. I just smiled and said, ‚ÄúRelax, it‚Äôs college.‚Äù

Funny enough, after that week, her late-night concerts mysteriously stopped. She never admitted defeat, but the silence was golden.

Don‚Äôt want to give me what you promised? Fine I‚Äôll take more.,"I work in a medium sized department. The raises are embarrassing but the work environment and culture are great. Good team work and interdepartmental collaboration.
Due to personal changes, had to take contract work long distance, (contract work is double the pay), >100 miles to qualify but since I love working here so much I agreed to stay part time and was told I could come back easily but for the time being no openings on dayshift. I go part time but night shift, openings arise and I‚Äôm passed up. Speak to the manager and am told I will not be going back to days because it sets a precedent for other good employees to follow. Fine. I‚Äôll stay nights for now but while I am, I‚Äôve convinced others to follow me whereas before I hadn‚Äôt tried to do anything. They don‚Äôt know yet but they‚Äôre about to lose at least 5 critical staff to contract work and more if I can help it.

That don't tell me nothing!,"In highschool I was attending an award ceremony breakfast. My group was seated with another school's participants and coach. They asked us where we were from. As we started answering they seemed unclear. I asked if they knew Auburn University. Then said we were from the city directly next to Auburn where the University is located. The coach/teacher said 'That don't tell me nothing.'
I'm a smart butt, always have been so I immediately asked them where are y'all from. They started answering. Explaining where this mountain is and there's a river next to it then the place they're from is right here.
One of my teammates leans over to the other and says Here it comes. 
I leaned forward so my chair returned to the floor and said That don't tell me nothing.

Party animals go a dose of their own medicine,"Years ago my grandmother passed away. My brother, sister and I all traveled to the funeral and were all leaving the next day. We drove to a hotel in St Louis where we got 2 rooms - one for me and my kids and another for my brother and sister. For some unknown reason the rooms they gave us were separated with a room between. We all had gone to bed when in the room between us a bunch of rowdy kids started a party. Loud music, loud talking etc. My brother and I both call the front desk. They send someone to tell the kids to quiet down. That lasted all of 10 minutes. We called the police on a disturbing the peace call. Again that lasted about 10 minutes. This party lasted into the early morning hours before it was quiet. Here‚Äôs where the petty revenge starts. My brother and I complain at the front desk. They discounted our rooms by 50% (should have been comped). So before we left my brother turned on the Tv, turned it around to face the middle room and cranked the volume. I couldn‚Äôt do the TV thing but could do it with the clock radio. I turned it on and cranked the volume. One of the kids popped out of the room and complained but we just shrugged him off. Hope they enjoyed the morning news and whatever music was on the radio!

No free lunch,"Once upon a time I worked for a nepot manager. She got the job as a Marketing Manager because the head of marketing decided to give her a shot, based on the performance of my boss's husband. In short, with zero skills she ran ""a department."" Story time: the president's son was the summer intern. My manager, ""Karen,"" thought a goodbye lunch would be a nice gesture. Karen sends two emails to the entire department. The lunch was twice an agenda item for the weekly meeting. Lunch was at a national burger chain. 

Following the lunch, again an agenda item, the department was asked for $0.87 each. The admin could not help herself and said, ""I think I can swing that."" Alright then. Karen and hubby had about $250,000 salary (adjusted for inflation). Springing for lunch out of Karen's pocket might have been nice. Or the whole department's meals could have been expensed. Nope.

The cost of sending so many emails is real money (far more than the total cost of the meal). I took a high road and spent the afternoon chatting with members of the department and asking if they would mind me paying their $0.87 debt to the boss. Near quitting time I gave the boss a ten dollar bill. I told her to keep the change.

What might have been a good bonding experience was ruined by a boss who penurisly asked for under a dollar per employee. With my time and the rest of the department's time spent on reading multiple emails, Karen wasted more than $1,000 in lost time. Was this her biggest blunder? Of course not.

"Want to make my life difficult after the break-up, let's make sure everyone knows what kinda person you really are.","This recently came up in a conversation with my sister and I thought it's perfect for petty revenge.

After me (25F) and my ex (26M) broke up, he made my life miserable, I am talking about contacting my friends and my sister to talk shit about me after I blocked him , posting on reddit about his version of the story and sending me the links to them among other things. It was overall a very messy situation.

He had all the classic traits of a narcissist pretending to be this awesome person.  Very woke, feminist, supportive of all his friends etc etc. But in reality he was just a piece of shit and hated on everyone which he used to proudly tell me.

Then the opportunity presented itself. His roomate who I was good friends with at that time invited me for a birthday celebration. I decided to go primarily to see his cat who I loved. The thing about my ex is he had a very close knit group of friends who had known each other for more than 10 year's and all of them are in each other's businesses. This group included a female friend of his who I was somewhat closeish. 

Keep in mind that all of them think he's some gift to mankindüôÑ and I decided that ended today. So on the day of the party when my ex was getting shitfaced I pulled aside the female friend, the roomates girlfriend and another girl in their group and laid out everything abusive he had done over the course of the relationship. Including bringing another girl to his room at night, all the gaslighting behaviour, his behaviour after the break up. I also added his somewhat problematic views regarding feminism and how misogyny is sometimes okay ( why was I even with himüò≠). Along with this I mentioned he criticized all of their relationships and especially not liking the roomates girlfriend. I threw in some "" I always defended you"" also. And then Ieft after eating the cake of course.

The fallout I got to know after a few months through another friend is that all of his friends confronted him  which led to a huge fight and he was to put it lightly let go from the group. Np longer invited to anything even though he lives in the same house. Now a few days back I got to know that he's moving away from the city.  So yeah this was quite satisfying to hear.

Bring your own drinks into the bar? Oh no they seem to have gone missing!,"Years ago, after graduating, I was assistant manager of a student union bar in the UK for a year.

For those unfamiliar, student union bars have cheap drinks, with all profits going towards funding events, societies, and sports teams. They also acted like a common rooms and students could hang out without having to buy anything. Bringing in outside drinks, however, wasn‚Äôt allowed. We would have to stop people brining outside drinks in maybe a couple of times a month.

Then one group started showing up every night with shopping bags full of booze. They never bought anything from the bar but got steadily drunk, so it was obvious something was up. They were a generally obnoxious bunch, rude to staff and other students. They hid their alcohol in a dark corridor near the toilets, dumping it under their coats. We caught them there a few times, told them it was staff only, and removed them but they kept at it.

So one night I waited until they stashed everything, then stepped out of the bar office (which opened right into that corridor), scooped up all their coats and bags (easily enough booze for a house party)  and took it all back into the office.

Ten minutes later, their self-appointed leader sheepishly approached me at the bar:

‚ÄúHello mate, what can I get you?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ nothing thanks‚Ä¶ we left our coats in the corridor, but they‚Äôve gone missing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the staff-only corridor we‚Äôve removed you from before? Why would you put them there?‚Äù

‚ÄúUhh, we were just storing them until we left.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll check if we‚Äôve had anything handed in. Meet me in the corridor.‚Äù

I came out of the office door they clearly didn‚Äôt realise existed with their coats and handed them over.

‚ÄúOh, we, um‚Ä¶ had some bags too.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was in them?‚Äù

‚ÄúErm‚Ä¶  wine, beer, and vodka and stuff.‚Äù

I popped my head back into the office for all of a second, returned with a smile, and said:

‚ÄúSorry, no one‚Äôs handed in anything like that.‚Äù

Long pause.

‚ÄúOh. Okay,‚Äù the leader muttered, delightfully dejected, and they all slunk off. 

I don‚Äôt think they set foot in the bar for the rest of the year.

Revenge is a dish best served with a separate check,"Over a decade or so ago when my wife (65F) and I (60M) lived in upstate NY, we lived across the road from a nice older couple that were at least a dozen or so years senior to my wife. So we were both obviously younger at the time. While I'm out talking across the road from him, ""Joey"" (we'll call him) and ""Linda"" decided it was time that they invite the neighbors out to dinner. We both figured we weren't being social enough in the neighborhood and it's good to have friendly neighbors, so we accepted with our mistaken intent.

First time was a Friday evening, we were both coming directly from work, so we met at the local Italian place he raved about. One thing to know about my wife and I are that we're not huge eaters and generally don't drink when out because, well, driving and my wife isn't crazy about alcohol. So we order modestly and our arrangement was to just split the bill. We order just mains and one starter my wife and I would share with them. They decide to go full bore, starting with drinks, each orders a starter, then go for mains, and desserts to top it off. We quickly figured out we were getting screwed on this deal, so we ordered desserts and the bill came in. They forked over exactly half. Plus tipping on the low side. We picked up the rest. Not too pleased with it, but we endured and it wasn't extremely expensive so we let it slide and knew the lay of the land.

Next time a few weeks hence, we drove together to a place along the Hudson River and already knew that we were taking the hit on this so I pulled Joe aside and said, ""Hey, we'll keep an eye on the check and chip in our share because we're light eaters."" Joey looked confused but caught on and begrudgingly agreed. Dinner went a little better this time and the next when he decided on The Chart House (and anyone who's been knows it's a bit pricey). But each time it became a contention as to how much we really owed, and my wife would give in and we'd kick in closer to half and make up the tip.

The next time, he decided that we should try this place that was more on the $$$$ scale, so when our waiter addressed our table, we ordered beverage and I excused myself to the restroom, then returned after a few minutes trying to hold back my Cheshire Cat grin. So dinner goes through our starters, mains, desserts, with Joey and Linda going duly overboard in their orders thinking that they'd show us how this was done. After an admittedly good meal, our waiter finally comes with their check. And ours. And the look of total horror on their faces was priceless since they hadn't realized that I'd arranged for our check to be tallied separately from theirs, and apparently theirs was more than double ours. 

Joey had this priceless look of fury and a face that was beet red with anger knowing that we totally got the upper hand and weren't feeding into his discounted dinners.

It was some months later, after some chatting across the road, that he decided to try dinner again, and as usual we said we'd meet him at the venue since we were coming from opposite directions due to other plans. Actually meeting them was a comedy of faked lost cell phone signals, stopped traffic on the Major Deegan or Cross Bronx or a slog across the Tappan Zee, until we finally said ""You'd better just go ahead and order, not sure when we'd actually get there."" To this day I don't know if they actually ate at that restaurant that night.

TL;DR -- Our neighbors across the road turned out to be moochers who screwed themselves over finally when they realized we got the upper hand on how to split the check and make them pay their fair share.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n7yb3t/revenge_is_a_dish_best_served_with_a_separate/,0.5269,0.06794759759280167
Revenge is a dish best served COCK!,"For Spring Break 2013 I road-tripped from Chicago to Denver to spend a few days hiking, biking, and hanging out at my friend Pete's place, with some of his CO friends.  Names are real, because Fuck You, Pete.  (note: we've been friends since 7th grade, this is our love language)

Took forever to wrap up loose ends before leaving Chicago, and I didn't hit the road until about 4:00am.  Got out of Chicagoland before traffic, and took a few power-naps along the way.

Super easy drive.  Boring AF drive, but easy.  Sunny, 50F or so.  Had the windows down during said power naps.  Was able to tune into March Madness through most of Nebraska.

Calming, Zen Drive.

And then things went to shit - clouds, then rain, then clumps of slush, then shitty snow, then holy f'in slip-n-slide Interstate 76.

The final 80 miles took almost three hours, much of it after sunset.

Arrived in Denver absolutely frazzled.  Friends wanted me to go out drinking with them, but I was done.  Joined in for a pre-game beer, and wished them well on their way out.

Sleep.  Euphoric sleep.

Until what seemed like 5 minutes later.  It was, in fact, about 5 hours later, a bit after 3:00am.

I regained consciousness to chants of, ""Taco Bell!‚Ä¶  Taco Bell!‚Ä¶""

Fuuuuuuuuuck.

The only way I could make it stop was to designated-drive them to Taco Bell.  A 24-Hour Taco Bell. WTF? I didn't even know that was a thing.

On the drive back, as the drunken assholes finally became silent (they were face-stuffing Taco Bell), I switched off the music and said, ""You know you guys are going to pay for this, right?""

""Don't care.  Taco Bell,"" was the only (somewhat muffled) (mouth full of tacomeat) reply.

Back to sleep by 4:00.  

Woke up AWAKE at about 8:00.  Made breakfast.  Debated fucking with the soon-to-be-hungover detritus splayed about the living room.

And there it was, right there on the coffee table:  Pete's phone.  

SETTINGS / AUTOCORRECT / 

Taco Bell -> COCK!

taco bell -> COCK!

tacobell -> COCK!

Enjoyed the rest of the trip.  Heard nothing about the autocorrect.

Drove back to Chicago:  Nothing.

Spring quarter:  Nothing

Summer: Nothing.

At this point I figured that either it didn't work, he blamed someone else, or he didn't want to give me the satisfaction.

2015:	Nothing

2016 - March 2020:		Nothing

COVID lockdown:  Get a text:  ""You motherfucker.""

Yeah I‚Äôm heartbroken but I won‚Äôt be the only one crying.,"
KIND OF IRRELEVANT:
I (28) have been in what I thought was a serious relationship for a year now with this man (25). There has been loads of drama, disagreements and he would leave his 4 year old son with me on multiple occasions. I am childless and I don‚Äôt plan to have children so I THOUGHT it would be ideal to be with a man who already has kids so he will not want any with me. 

His child and I don‚Äôt speak the same language and I‚Äôm essentially a stranger to this child so it was quite frustrating baby sitting him. Then additionally his child would wet the bed, refuse to eat and generally misbehave when he leaves me with the child. 

Again I couldn‚Äôt discipline the child properly due to a language barrier. This man ‚ÄúP‚Äù would berate me for not immediately bonding with his child, everything I did ‚Äúwrong‚Äù regarding his child and etc. P has not been a physically present father in his child‚Äôs life from ages 0-4.

So I told him you‚Äôre just projecting your self doubt and frustrations onto me. Because if anyone should be bonding with this child and parenting him properly it‚Äôs you, first and then I follow your lead.

He had the GALL to tell me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fit to be a mother‚Äù. Like that was supposed to hurt my feelings I was thinking ‚ÄúDUH! That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt plan to have kids‚Äù

Then he asked me ‚Äúwhere is your motherly instinct?‚Äù In the moment I couldn‚Äôt manage to ask him ‚Äúwhere is yours‚Äù. Because that comment alone threw me for a LOOP.

Me: ‚ÄúWHAT MOTHERLY INSTINCTS?!‚Ä¶..from where? I don‚Äôt have kids, I don‚Äôt want to birth kids‚Äù
P: ‚Äúwell what about the motherly instincts from your mother ?‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúWTF, you know I did not even grow up with my mother, so instincts from where?!‚Äù

Now he could have been an asshole all along or I only took note of it after this argument. But he did come back to me and apologised for having unreasonable expectations of me. Then he confessed he wanted me to be the child‚Äôs ‚Äúmother‚Äù which is literally impossible , that boy already has a mother and I also asked him ‚Äúwhat is a mother to you exactly?‚Äù. A child has 2 parents and you can‚Äôt expect one parent to do all the child rearing little boys need their dads etc etc.

TOXIC RELATIONSHIP SHIT:

After this specific argument. I noticed his behaviour changed or he was always a dickhead. He would be really cold and mean to me. Withold sex and intimacy, Ignore my calls and text messages. Start unnecessary fake fights. Say fucked up shit like ‚ÄúI forgot sex with you is always amazing‚Äù and ‚ÄúI forgot I actually missed you‚Äù. I asked him directly ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you want to be with someone else?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is your problem?‚Äù. He would ignore or dismiss my concerns and give very empty reassurances. 

That‚Äôs when I knew some fuck shit was happening. I told myself to be patient and eventually he‚Äôll get overconfident and slip up. I needed evidence so there would be no way for him to manipulate me into thinking otherwise, like he has been doing. 

MY LICK BACK:

And so it happened. His phone broke and for work he always needs to be reachable. So he started using my old iPhone without asking me permission. When I tried to just ask him about the iPhone, he immediately got angry and said ‚Äúthere you go again about YOUR phone‚Ä¶blah blah‚Äù. My iPhone is registered to my iCloud.

So I could see his whole call log. There was some very suspicious phone calls to the same women everyday.I thought that‚Äôs not enough.

Then I found a prescription for STD medication in his coat, when I was doing laundry and one of the call girls‚Äô name was on the prescription.
I thought again that‚Äôs not enough.

So obviously it‚Äôs my iPhone with my biometrics password. Therefore, post some very dissatisfying, some of his worst work, coitus.  I knew he would pass out. I began my scheme.


I waited for him to start snoring because that is when I knew he was in a deep sleep.
Reached over for my old iPhone. Started going through text messages and social media. Some messages were deleted of course but I got the gist.
It was all there, he was cheating on me with MULTIPLE WOMEN. He and the STD call girl both got treated so when was he gonna tell me to get treated? What an asshole.

I was furious and then I thought up a plan. According to their conversation: STD girl seemed to be irate and jealous because she had an inkling that he is a WHORE. Then there was new girl and it seemed they were saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äôs‚Äù to each other but haven‚Äôt had sex yet. Maybe she lives far away, maybe she doesn‚Äôt give it up easy. Who knows?

So I thought I‚Äôll get a spoof text number. Text STD girl with all the contact details of new girl and the text went something like ‚ÄúHi (insert name) you‚Äôve been trying to reach P right? Text (new girl) her number is XXXX he‚Äôs been with her this whole time while ignoring you‚Äù

The next morning P‚Äôs day was absolute chaos. He couldn‚Äôt figure out who this spoof number was. STD girl called new girl and now they were both giving him hell. He was anxious the spam number would text me next since they are revealing all the WHORE shit he has been up to. I pretended like I didn‚Äôt know a thing, I also texted myself with the spoof number ‚Äúhey are you OP? Ask your man who STD girl is‚Äù.

He suspected I was behind it all but I was coy. SOME OTHER BS happened ( I‚Äôll post it in the comments if anyone would like to know)And then I ‚Äúconfronted‚Äù him with tears, yelling and the works. Told him after that anonymous text message and the STD medication prescription obviously he is cheating.

He thinks STD girl did it. Last we spoke he was furious with her for blowing up his WHORING just because she was bitter that she was a side chick (according to him üôÑ)

Meanwhile I‚Äôm just chuckling at him spiralling. 


Yeah I‚Äôm heartbroken, obviously this is the end of that fake ass relationship. But I‚Äôm not the only one crying üòÇüòÇüòÇ. We are all gonna be heartbroken. Whomp whomp sucks to suck.

PS: no they are not call girls as in sex workers, I‚Äôm just making a pun.


UPDATE:  THE ADDITIONAL TEA

The more, is just more context on the plan and how it played out‚Ä¶ For my plan to work I had a friend of mine that he has never heard of help me. She asked me ‚Äúokay you‚Äôll spoof text STD girl but how will you know she called New girl?‚Äù

I confidently told my friend, STD girl seems like a crash out and like she has feelings for this man. I also had a feeling she knew he was in a ‚Äúpublic‚Äù relationship with me. So she will be the perfect person to set up.

My friend had her doubts but I told her don‚Äôt worry, have patience‚Ä¶

The spoof text was sent to STD girl at night so now we wait‚Ä¶and he did not come over to my place that night. In the morning, he came over acting like a guilty kid that was caught doing something bad.

He asked me ‚Äúhey did you receive any upsetting text message last night?‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúNo, upsetting how?‚Äù P: ‚Äúyou tell me ü§®‚Äù Me: ‚Äúhuh, how would I know if you‚Äôre asking me about it?‚Ä¶like did someone die or something?‚Äù P: ‚Äúhmm.. I thought it was a text sent to everybody‚Äù Me: ‚Äúwho‚Äôs everybody? What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù P:‚Äùwe will talk about it later‚Äù

That‚Äôs how I knew it was working. After that in the call log there was a bunch of incoming and outgoing calls to STD girl and New girl.

MUHAHAHAHA.üòàüòàüòàüòà So my friend helped me in this way. New girl called the spoof number and my friend answered. She was asking ‚Äúhow did you get my number and send it to STD girl? Blah blah‚Äù My friend said ‚Äúyou must be sorely mistaken because I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù.

Then New girl while speaking to my friend asked her ‚Äúcan I call you back and connect STD girl for a three way call?‚Äù. My friend said ‚Äúyes‚Äù and then blocked New girl, STD girl and P‚Äôs cellphone numbers.

That‚Äôs how I knew my plan went perfectly.üòà

Then he happened to find me on my lunch break, he asked ‚Äúwhat exactly are you up to? ü§®‚Äù Me: warming up my lunch P: haha very funny.. Me (concerningly): ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on, you said we would talk about an upsetting text or something?‚Äù

He then explained some convoluted story about an anonymous number texting him, then later it became an unknown number that texted his ‚Äúclose friends‚Äù and this unknown number texted something about my name. Then he said the text said something along the lines of stay away from my man. The spoof number belongs to an ‚ÄúEva‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOP who is Eva?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù New girl called him while we were talking so I said his name loudly and he had to hang up the call. But before he hung up I heard him say to her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know this number I‚Äôve never seen it before, I‚Äôm also trying to figure out who Eva is‚Äù üòàüòàüòà

I told him he wasn‚Äôt making any sense. He told me ‚Äúlisten you might find out about something and then you‚Äôre gonna hate me‚Ä¶.I think my little secret is out‚Ä¶don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs nothing that can hurt you‚Äù I was SEETHING but I played it cool‚Ä¶ P: ‚Äúlisten for the next 7 days I‚Äôm going to avoid you‚Äù Me: ‚Äúwhy? I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong? ü•∫‚Äù P: ‚Äúyes you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong but it‚Äôs for your own good because that text I‚Äôm talking about it‚Äôs eventually going to reach you‚Äù Me: ‚Äúwhat exactly is this text? Why don‚Äôt you just show it to me?‚Äù P: ‚Äú it‚Äôs for your own protection‚Ä¶but we can still call and text I just won‚Äôt come over to your place and you can‚Äôt come over to mine.  I‚Äôm giving you space, I‚Äôm doing this for you ü•π‚Äù WHAT A FUCKING LIAR! He kept my spare key to my apartment.

The next morning he jumped on my bed and woke me up playfully acting all giddy. How the FUCK can he do that after he just told me we were gonna have ‚Äúspace‚Äù. Also because I‚Äôm the only one that didn‚Äôt blow up his phone last night he probably thought the text hadn‚Äôt reached me. When he saw I wasn‚Äôt enthusiastic about him randomly popping up. He was about to runaway on some ‚Äúyou have bad vibes so I‚Äôm just gonna go..see you later‚Äù

That pissed me off so much. So at first I confronted him about the STD prescription. His attempts to triangulate and huff and puff and trying to stall didn‚Äôt work.

He went to the bathroom probably to delete all his texts because after he confesses he would have to hand over my old iPhone.

Then he confessed to cheating with the STD girl . I applied pressure on him to confess ‚ÄúWho else P?! Who else have you been talking to and fucking behind my back?!‚Äù

He only answered ‚ÄúI only had sex with STD girl once‚Äù I kept pushing and that‚Äôs when he accused me of being the spoof number. So I conveniently showed him the text I also got from the spoof number. He was dumbfounded and angrily whispered ‚Äúso it WAS STD girl all along, damn she‚Äôs crazy why did she have to do this‚Ä¶how did she get your number too?‚Äù

I told him to look me in the eyes and I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a coward, do you know that? Did you know you‚Äôre a coward.‚Äù

He was near to tears üòÇüòÇüòÇ and repeated ‚Äúyes I am a coward‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

I told him he doesn‚Äôt have to pretend to love me anymore. If he didn‚Äôt want to be with me, he could have just broken up with me.

He said ‚Äúbut I did want to be with you‚Ä¶seems I lost sight of that ü•∫can this be fixed?‚Äù Me: ‚Äúfixed? FIXED?! üëπ. You ü´µüèæ are the one who went to go fuck people behind my back. So tell me Mr. Man of the hour, man of the house with the massive ego. Please tell me what was your plan? You get caught and then what?!

I‚Äôm waiting what‚Äôs with the silence Mr. Popular?‚Äù

P: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry OP‚Äù Me: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just sorry you got caught‚Äù P: ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not sorry I got caught‚Ä¶you know what, you got one over me. That was a real good one OP‚Äù. I did not respond the exact same way he would ignore me when I brought up concerns.

So maybe he has figured out that I was behind it all. Maybe he still suspects STD girl,but so what. I don‚Äôt care. The damage has been done. Now he has to build up his Rolodex of victims to manipulate all over again BOO FUCKING HOO.

After that he walked me to work while I was on a work call. Then he tried to ask me something about the call I was on, I just ignored him.

Haven‚Äôt spoken to him since, I don‚Äôt care to hear from him ever again. I have nothing to say and some things don‚Äôt need to be said aloud. He knows it‚Äôs over.

TLDR: My ex put me through a lot of bulshit then relentlessly cheated on me,so I plotted for  his ‚Äúside‚Äù chicks to fight each other while I play dumb,sit in the shadows and enjoy the chaos. Yeah it‚Äôs over but it ended with a delicious BOOM!

Don‚Äôt want to pay rent? Enjoy being the only one on the lease,"This happened a few months ago, but my old roommate is just now feeling the fallout.

I [29M] lived in a house with two other guys [27M & 30M]. We‚Äôd been together for about 4 years with zero issues.

Then out of nowhere, one of them stopped paying his share of rent and bills. We later found out it was because of a meth addiction that had spiraled.

By the time his debt hit around $2,000, we sat him down and told him he either needed to pay up or move out. His response? ‚ÄúWell you can‚Äôt actually evict me, so you‚Äôll have to cover it unless you want all of us evicted.‚Äù

We looked into our options and found a little-known program in our state for people in unsafe living situations (the ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù part is a whole other story). Basically, if a therapist signs off that you need to move for your safety, your landlord has to let you out of your portion of the lease without penalty.

So the other roommate and I did exactly that. There‚Äôs a 30-day period between giving notice and actually being released, and honestly those 30 days were glorious.

The problem roommate clearly thought he‚Äôd cracked some magic solution and acted like he was on top of the world. Then right before day 30, he went away for a long weekend‚Ä¶ and we used the chance to move out in record time.

When he came back, he blew up our phones, calling us shitty for ‚Äúditching‚Äù him and claiming it was underhanded to leave him with the lease.

I don‚Äôt know if he ended up evicted or if he managed to get out of it himself, but last I heard from a mutual friend, he was homeless and crashing on his mom‚Äôs couch.

Tl;dr: try to stick me with paying your rent? Here‚Äôs my uno reverse card fucker 


A couple of edits/clarifications: the program we used was the Address Confidentiality Program (ACP). In my original post I said ‚Äútherapist,‚Äù but it was more like a case worker who reviewed our situation.

For those asking what made it unsafe: it wasn‚Äôt just the unpaid rent. Our roommate‚Äôs meth use escalated to the point where he stayed up for days, brought sketchy strangers into the house at all hours, and once even waved a gun around during a meth binge, amongst other things. The worker agreed those things qualified as unsafe living conditions.

Once I got the ACP card, my good roommate followed the same steps and got his own. We planned the move for a major holiday weekend when we had extra time off work. The fact that the problem roommate was out of town was just the cherry on top tbh

If you or someone you know is in an unsafe living environment, look into ACP. It saved us from a bad situation before it got worse. And one more thing: the case worker told me I should have gone the ACP route long before things got that bad, so don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs extreme.

And for closure: I checked the local court database, and sure enough, he was formally evicted after we left.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n72v7d/dont_want_to_pay_rent_enjoy_being_the_only_one_on/,0.9769,0.06972264392896722
One more pen petty revenge,"My boss was so stingy--I swear this is true--that on your first day of work, you were given one pen. 

When you needed a replacement, you had to turn in the old, out-of-ink pen to get another. If you lost it, tough. You had to replace it. 

Most employees just rolled their eyes and bought their own pens. 

Not me. I can be as petty as I need to be. 

I started collecting free giveaway pens for work.      
Joe's bail bonds? My new work pen.        
Jack's gentlemen club (complete with topless stripper imprint)? New work pen. 

My boss would give me The Look when I used that pen in front of a customer, but he didn't break. 

Eventually, I had a container of those pens on my desk. They started to disappear. A few at a time, and only the most offensive ones.

After thinking about it for a few days, I decided pens were important. My boss said so. You must keep track of your pen because it would not be replaced. So every time a pen went missing, I made a big stink. ""Have you seen my stripper pen? Somebody took it. I have to find it!"" I looked through all the desks. I complained to everyone: my boss, my co-workers, the customers. 

One day I came to work and every employee had a pack of new pens on their desk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n76kph/one_more_pen_petty_revenge/,-0.9494,0.08617894266291204
"Overzealous MIL doesn't respect food boundaries, gets hit with a fart machine","To preface, I love my MIL and value and appreciate everything she does for my family. But she really leans into her role as a grandmother and has said ""I'm a grandma, I can do whatever I want."" whenever we ask her to respect our food choices for our kid. This means spoiling her grandkids with sweets and treats against her kids' wishes at every with. Her kitchen has full cookie drawers at all times. I once watched her give my 8 year old nephew a full angle food cake ""just to see what he would do"" (spoiler: he ate the full thing and then got sick).

So over the weekend we're staying at her house and my 3.5 year old son is very well aware that she'll give him whatever he wants. It's breakfast time and he's asking for ice cream and cookies, to which I say no and redirect him to his banana and yogurt. She gives him the chocolate chip cookies anyway and I say ""I'd appreciate you not feeding my son cookies before 8:30 in the morning."" She just smiles and says ""oh come on, let him live a little!""

Later that morning my wife and I are out shopping at one of those beach/tchotchke stores (it's a coastal town, you know the type) and I overhear someone else say ""who would want a fart-noise-maker on a keychain??"". 

Well.... this guy. 

My MIL absolutely HATES potty humor and my son is a 3.5 year old boy so, yeah, farts are the funniest thing in his world right now. I bring it home and it goes exactly as I predicted - she hates it and he loves it, but she can't say anything because she sees how much he's enjoying himself. The thing has six different noises and he's absolutely laying into, having a blast, and all-around cackling. 

So my MIL is grumbling about how disgusting it is and how she hopes it breaks, and I just shoot her a grin and say ""oh come on... let him live a little!'",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n6r4eu/overzealous_mil_doesnt_respect_food_boundaries/,0.9881,0.09959032122009578
I'm quite attached to it,"Some years back I bought myself a new car. I'm not normally into possessions, but it was nice to have something that I did need that hadn't been previously owned by someone else.
On the first week I owned it, I bought some after-market car mats and seat covers to bling it up.
The following weekend, my wife and I grabbed a couple of cd's and jumped in the car to go for a drive out of town.
We were going along a long  sweeping bend on a country road when we hit something on the road. The front tire instantly shredded, and, as the car was front wheel drive, I lost control. We spun off the road. Fortunatel,  we weren't hurt, but the car was badly damaged.
The car got towed away to the yard. 
Sometime later, i got a call from my insurance agent to tell me that it wasn't worth repairing and that they would pay me out.
All good.
We got a replacement car shortly after. I picked it up, and  then I remembered about the cd's and mats that were still in the original car. As we had bought them separately from the car. I rang the agent to see if we could get them back.
The agent made inquiriess and rang us back. The car had since been on-sold. He contacted the new owner, who said that ""he had grown attached to the items and wanted to keep them.""
I was more annoyed at the new owner's arrogant attitude than losing my stuff, but it wasn't worth  getting worked up about.
Then, a few weeks later, the agent rang me back. The new owner was asking if I still had the spare key. It was one of those transponder things and was quite expensive. 
I looked around and found it. Then I took great pleasure in telling the agent that ""I had grown attached to the key and I wanted to keep it.""
We both had a laugh. He rang the new owner back with the news, and I threw the key in the rubbish.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n6wv52/im_quite_attached_to_it/,0.6885,0.0863159154117461

"Another ""Couldn't let 5 cents slide"" story","Actually it was 7 cents.  This happened almost 50 years ago, when we used to pay for everything with cash.

My friends and I were planning a big party. My buddy and I went to the local ""Big Beer"" store to buy a 1/2 keg, as it was the only place in town that sold kegs.  The clerk told us the price, we pooled our money, and we were 7 cents short (on a roughly 50 dollar sale).  We asked if he'd give it to us for 7 cents off.  He said no, can't do it.

We called out the Big Beer store manager, and asked him if he'd give us 7 cents off on the price,  Same answer; No, can't do it.  We went out to the car, searched under the seats for stray coins, no luck.  Still 7 cents short.  

We went back into the store to try again.  The manager, with a predatory grin, said why don't you boys just buy several cases of beer instead.  

We knew we'd get less beer for the money that way and the store would make more profit. That's why we wanted the keg in the first place.

My buddy said ""Good idea, we'll just buy several cases... from the little Mom & Pop grocery store across the street"", and he headed for the door.

I've never seen a predatory grin disappear from a store manager's face so quickly.  It was priceless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n6k2c9/another_couldnt_let_5_cents_slide_story/,0.9233,0.09971009976620455
I lied to my pick-me ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and she got a tattoo based off of it,"If you have any questions or want the update, check out:
[OG post](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/FTb4vuMut6)

It‚Äôs been about 2 years since this happened-but I just got confirmation from a friend who attended her tattoo appointment that it was because of what I said. 

The Backstory:

I (25F) was introduced to Peggy (fake name)(25F) through a mutual friend. She had recently moved in to the friend‚Äôs neighboring apartment unit and was quickly introduced to our friend group. Almost immediately, I could tell we weren‚Äôt going to get along based off of some backhanded compliments that were given; but I decided that it was too quick to judge her fairly and invited her to a game night that a friend and I were hosting. 

Huge mistake. 

Game one: Sardines. During a drunken game of sardines in the dark, Peggy faked a fall and pushed my head into a shelf. How do I know she faked it? Because she literally told me in front of everyone and LAUGHED about it saying ‚ÄúI found him first- that‚Äôs why I pushed you‚Äù.

Game two: Kings cup. Peggy called me out during the ‚Äúnever have I ever‚Äù portion for having gone through a divorce. Talking about it normally wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me since everyone who was there already knew about it and were really supportive during that time- but it was the fact that she was trying to single me out and shame me for it.

Throughout the rest of the night this kind of behavior continued, and by the end, I was thoroughly convinced she had some sort of vendetta against me. Finding out what -or in my case WHO- it was, took almost no time at all. 

One of our friends (who we‚Äôll call Mark) was in attendance that first night. Mark (28M) is a tall, kind, funny, and generally attractive guy. Essentially, he‚Äôs catnip for her type. At this time, we were pretty close friends and Peggy did not like that. For the next 6 months, anytime he was around I had to deal with the most ridiculous, awkward, and petty attempts of her trying to single me out or embarrass me. 

Now here‚Äôs where the tattoo comes into play:

I had been planning on getting a dragon tattoo for over a year. I am fully aware that dragons are a common and trending tattoo, but I wanted it anyways because it was special to me and my mom. I had even worked with my tattoo artist on incorporating her favorite flowers into the piece and figuring out what kind of style/other details I wanted. 

About a month before my appointment, Peggy heard a friend and I talking about the tattoo and started asking questions. I swear I could see the moment the lightbulb went off in her head because she grew the biggest sh*t-eating grin I have ever seen. 

My lightbulb moment happened shortly after. 

When she asked where and what kind of dragon tattoo I wanted to get, I lied. I told her about how much I loved the movie ‚ÄúSpirited Away‚Äù (because I do- it‚Äôs a banger) and went on a tangent about how I grew up on that movie, how my dad showed it to me, and that, ‚Äúit‚Äôd be cool if he (Haku) was wrapping around my arm or something‚Äù. 

(If you haven‚Äôt seen the movie, one of the main characters is a boy named Haku who turns into a dragon)

Peggy had never seen this movie before, so I encouraged her to check it out and ended the conversation there.

Now, considering she had never seen it before, I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd actually do it. But Reddit. She did it. And it wasn‚Äôt just a tiny-cutesy little thing either. She committed to my EXACT DESCRIPTION. The thing is freaking hugeü§£üò≠üò≠

When she showed it to me two weeks later, I was in shock and she probably thought I was upset for taking something from me. But I went home that night and switched between feeling awful for lying to her and laughing for how utterly unbelievable she was for doing it. 2 years later and I‚Äôm still doing that. 

I had confessed to a friend recently about my lie and that‚Äôs when she told me. She went to the tattoo appointment with Peggy that day. And word for word Peggy had said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to be so upset. This is like the exact tattoo she wanted‚Äù.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n62o7r/i_lied_to_my_pickme_friend_and_she_got_a_tattoo/,0.9932,0.0591901104307057
I changed my fianc√©s Tinder account,"Well, it‚Äôs exactly as it reads.

I (30F) was engaged to my fianc√© (32M)‚Ä¶. until I wasn‚Äôt.  40 days before the wedding I found out he was cheating. I had a dress, we had flights (destination elopement), it was 40!!! DAYS OUT lol.

Anyway, he had a Tinder account & was telling women we were polyamorous if it came up.

Well, before I fully called off the engagement I went on his phone & changed the Tinder account. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs petty or evil. We had two kids, a home, a whole ass life.

So, I changed the account. Replaced his photos with mine, deleted his bio  & even paid the like $8??? Fee so he could see how many likes were coming in.

When he seen it, he shit bricks. After maybe 6 hours, there were already thousands of likes-  men trying to match me.

Shortly after I made him leave (I own the home) & canceled the entire wedding. Needless to say, I am doing MUCH better these days.

Happiness is the best revenge,"I was working at a job where I had two coworkers/assistants. Their job position was intended to partially support mine, and partially they worked independently as well.  I reported directly to the manager. 

These two gals were nasty and decided to try to get me fired because one of them wanted my position. They kept running to the manager with frivolous complaints about me and constantly undermined my work by not doing the support work.  In addition, two other people left at the same time so pretty soon I was overwhelmed, overworked, and miserable, working what felt like three jobs instead of one. 

The more miserable I got, the more visibly happy they were.  And I would get even more sad, because I once thought of these gals as friends. I felt like I was carrying so much weight on my shoulders, feeling unsupported by my manager, being attacked by these women who were once my friends, and just physically and emotionally overwhelmed with so much work. I was running myself ragged and really letting go of my appearance and just looked so bedraggled 

One day I was sitting in my apartment crying, thinking about the smirks on their faces when I left that day. And then I thought to myself, wait a minute, if they are so happy seeing me miserable, then the opposite must be true? What if they saw me happy? 

The next day, I woke up. Combed my hair, wore makeup, put on the nicest clean clothes I had.  Then I went to my job and pranced in with a huge smile on my face like I was on cloud nine.  I chatted happily with my favorite coworker loudly, who sat  next to the other two women.  I watched those two gals out of the corner of my eye, and they exchanged a wide eyed look that said, ""We're doomed."" 

The next week they tried their best to annoy me. One of them kept interrupting me constantly, unnecessarily, and every time I gushed with smiles and gratitude. The disappointment on her face was downright hilarious.  

I enjoyed smiling at them every time I passed by, saying over the top sweetly please and thank you, and acting so incredibly considerate towards them every chance I got. It drove them insane. Pretty soon, they were looking terrified and miserable. 

It became fairly apparent that they thought I had some secret discussion with the manager. 
At one point one of the gals had an outburst and went and yelled at the manager saying ""you are going to fire me anyway!""

She did get fired. And it was not because I said ANYTHING to the manager. It was only because she couldn't handle me being happy. The other one was scared into silence after that. 

I eventually left the job because the management sucked.  I still am in awe at how just appearing happy and being super nice affected them so much. I got to make them as miserable as they made me, without having to be actually unkind to them like they were to me.

Taking more than your share? Let me help with that.,"As we all know, food prices in the US continue to rise. This lovely Monday, I was very excited to find family packs of chicken at my local supermarket at 99 cents/lb, with a limit of 4. I took one, then later decided to grab a second one for freezing. 

Walking to the fridge, I found a man clearing out the last of the entire row of chicken (~14 packs) into his cart. I said, ‚Äúwow, I was hoping to get one of those!‚Äù, and he replied back ‚Äúoh, these will be for my dog‚Äù indicating down to his leashed French bulldog and smiling meanly at me. Then he pointed to the $1.79 chicken and said ‚Äúyou can have that one‚Äù. 

I smiled at him and started digging. With some luck, I was able to find one last 99 cent chicken pack in the back behind some wings. 

Getting up to the front, there were two open checkout lanes: express (10 items or less) and one regular lane. So I started a friendly conversation with the cashier:

Me: ‚ÄúGosh, this is a great price for chicken! Is there a limit on how many?‚Äù 

Cashier: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure! Let me check [opening the sales ad]‚Ä¶ah, it‚Äôs a limit of 4. Would you like to get 2 more?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs alright. Thank you for checking!‚Äù 

Then I turned to my partner and said ‚ÄúI can see how they‚Äôd limit how many you can take at such a price‚Äù, and walked out. 

Enjoy putting your chicken back, old man.

A friend suggested buying black pens and pink pens and swap the ink so that nobody will want to steal my pink pens, which I decide to do.  Now I have 6 pink pens in the cup on my desk with black ink, and then the idea hits.  Leave the black pens with pink ink in there also, and wait.

Revenge is a dish best served stinky.,"I once ate something that didn't agree with me,  and my entire digestive system protested by cursing me with horrible farts. My noxious emissions smelled like a corpse smothered in rotting garbage juice and dirty diapers festering in a den of skunks. It was that bad.
 Went to the gas station to get some ginger ale to possibly settle my stomach a bit and prevent the wife from filing for divorce, calling an excorcist, maybe even both. She'd probably have had a solid case for attempted murder at this point. 
This old lady was being a karen because she forgot her ID and they wouldn't sell her a fifth of vodka. I thought I was gonna be in that line forever, until I felt the pressure coming on. This was my chance. I let one slip out, and it was the longest, warmest, silent fart I've ever let out. It was so foul I swear the paint on the walls changed colors, just like the cashiers face. I'd never seen that shade of green on a human before. 
 I said ""lady, you're obviously already drunk off your face anyways. Pretty sure you just crapped your pants. It'd be illegal to serve you anything."" She protested angrily, turning like three different shades of red. The cashier retched like a cat horking up a giant hairball, and with tears in his eyes yelled at her to get out. She tried denying it, but nobody believed it wasn't her. She stormed out, seething with rage and nausea.

"I beat out an impatient ""rat-runner""","If you don't know what a rat-runner is, it's a person who drives through parking lots, gas stations, and other establishments or roads to avoid waiting at a stop light. It's illegal (?) in most places (if not all states), but it's hard to enforce.

Anyways, I was waiting to turn right on a street, with 3-4 cars in front of me. You can turn on red, but I guess the first car is going straight. All of a sudden, I hear this honking, and I see this black truck behind me (why is it always these trucks). I realized he wanted me to move so he could go into the gas station next to us to beat out the traffic light. But this traffic light doesn't even take long to change. It would turn green soon. But no, this man got places to be and kept honking at me, even doing the whole exasperated, throwing his arms at me charade to show his displeasure. I couldn't move without being bumper to bumper with the car in front. The cars in front realized my situation (because he wouldn't stop honking) and moved a bit so I could move. Guy goes into the gas station and didn't even do the sorry hand thing or anything and just did the whole charade of disappointment again like this whole thing is my fault. 

Ah, but the second he did that, the light turned green üòÇ.

"Neighbor kept treating my driveway like free parking, so I taught him a $300 lesson","
Okay so this is a bit long but I need to get it off my chest. I live in a small cul-de-sac, nothing fancy, just your average neighborhood. My driveway fits two cars (mine + my husband‚Äôs) perfectly fine. For the most part everyone here minds their own business.

Except my neighbor (let‚Äôs just call him Jack). For whatever reason, he thinks my driveway is like‚Ä¶ extra parking for his family/friends. First time it happened I thought it was a mistake. His brother‚Äôs car was in there, he said it‚Äôd ‚Äújust be a sec.‚Äù A week later it was some friend of his ‚Äúdropping something off.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt love it, but I figured whatever, not worth making it awkward.

But it kept happening. I‚Äôd come home from work (I‚Äôm a nurse, so some days I‚Äôm wiped out), and there‚Äôs a random car blocking me. One night I literally had to park halfway down the street and carry 5 bags of groceries because his buddy‚Äôs truck was in my spot. Every time I said something, he‚Äôd do that half-smile and go, ‚ÄúOh yeah, sorry, they‚Äôll be gone soon.‚Äù Like I‚Äôm the one being difficult.

The final straw: I get home late Friday night after a 12 hr shift. Still in scrubs, starving, with takeout that‚Äôs already getting cold in the passenger seat. And boom, giant white SUV just parked dead center in my driveway. Not even off to the side. Like, full on blocking me from even pulling in.

I knock, no answer. I call Jack, he finally picks up, and super casual goes: ‚ÄúOh yeah that‚Äôs my in-laws. They‚Äôll only be there a couple hours. Just park on the street, it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù

That was it for me.

I called a tow truck. (And yes, I checked before ‚Äî where I live if someone blocks your private driveway, you‚Äôre allowed to tow immediately.) Tow guy showed up in 20 mins, SUV was gone before I even finished half my fries.

About an hour later, furious pounding on my door. Jack‚Äôs beet red, his in-laws are yelling in the background, and he‚Äôs going off about how I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have to take it that far.‚Äù I just said, ‚ÄúYou told me it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, so I treated it like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.‚Äù Then I closed the door.

They had to pay almost $300 to get their car back. And funny enough, ever since then, my driveway has stayed crystal clear. Not even for ‚Äújust a sec.‚Äù

Be a horrible entitled bit*h during the breakup? Enjoy paying for it!,"I had a horrendous break up with my ex fianc√© around 8 years back. Highlights of this break up include:

1) I should pay her new deposit on an apartment that she couldn't afford and expected me to pay rent with the money from my new job overseas. 
2) Demanding I take out loans and credit cards to fund her lifestyle after we broke up
3) After we broke up, stormed into a family event and yelled about what a horrible partner I was and said I cheated on her ( i didnt)
4) Had to get a restraining order after she followed me home from work.

So after all of the above that happened, after 2 months I had moved overseas to a better job. However I didn't have much savings as I had literally sold everything and packed a suitcase.

The exchange rate was also 2.3 to 1. This meant that my money wouldn't go as far. 

I had to live off my very meagre savings until my first paycheck. This meant I lived off noodles, oats and bananas.

I was quite hungry one evening and was desperately hungry. I opened Uber eats to look for a small meal. While browsing I realized that my ex's credit card was linked to the account ( I wasn't sure why this was), so I ordered a really big pizza with all the sides and guess what? It went through. I did this for the 2 weeks before my first paycheck came through.

I did this for another 2 weeks when the card stopped working. 

TLDR: Enjoyed my food. It was delicious!

"Couldn‚Äôt Let Five Cents Slide, So I Guess I Can‚Äôt Pay Either","Short context:

This happened to my dad. In our city, most buses have someone stationed near the middle, next to the turnstile, whose job is to collect fares from passengers. Unlike places where the driver handles payments or where everything is automated, this person takes cash, gives change, and makes sure everyone pays before moving past the turnstile.



It was late at night, and my dad was heading home after work. Things were difficult for us at the time, and he had just enough money for the fare. He had even checked it beforehand to be sure. But when he got on the bus, he realized he was missing a small coin. Just five cents. The fare was 1.25$.



The fare collector did not let it slide. Instead, he made a scene, shouting and humiliating my dad in front of everyone. He even said that people who do not have enough money should not be riding the bus. It was cruel and completely unnecessary. Thankfully, someone nearby saw what was happening and kindly offered their transit pass so my dad could ride.



Now here is the twist. Two weeks later, same bus, same fare collector. This time, remembering what had happened my dad used a higher value bill, not one that the guy could have enough change for, and tried to pay normally. And how unfortunate, the fare collector did not have enough change. He was short by twenty five cents. So he asked my dad if he could owe him the difference and settle it later. Normally that wouldnt be an issue but... 

My dad just looked at him and said, ‚ÄúOh, you want me to let that slide? Funny considering what happened two weeks ago. I guess I can‚Äôt pay now either. No worries tho I‚Äôll be staying on the bus. Just let the driver know to open the door when I get off.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n46f8u/couldnt_let_five_cents_slide_so_i_guess_i_cant/,0.5212,0.09314797703659787
Neighbor‚Äôs aggressive dogs kept attacking mine‚Ä¶ so I went full neighborhood tattletale,"For context: I have 3 dogs. I‚Äôm super conscious of being a responsible owner. If they bark outside, they‚Äôre brought in immediately and each one of them has been trained extensively in obedience.

My neighbors also have 3 dogs. When they first moved in, they were shocked at how well-trained mine were. I could tell it made them insecure because theirs were (and still are) out-of-control, reactive, and constantly barking. So when they would see me address mine they would tell me ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do that they‚Äôre just being dogs and doing their job!‚Äù Translation: they don‚Äôt want to feel bad about their own dogs chaotic behavior.

Now my yard is fenced in with a vinyl picket fence ($8k). They built their fence using mine as the fourth wall which wasn‚Äôt an issue‚Ä¶ until one of their dogs started repeatedly trying to break through my fence to attack mine.

I went above and beyond to avoid conflict and installed privacy backing on my fence and planted 15 boxwoods ($1k more) in an attempt to block the view so their dog wouldn‚Äôt go berserk. Neighbors husband literally mocked me saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not gonna work, they‚Äôll still hear each other.‚Äù Spoiler: he was right.

So after the extra financial investment and labor intensive work of planting the bushes didn‚Äôt work I sent a polite, carefully worded text and asked that they prevent their dog from attacking my fence as I was concerned it was gonna eventually break, offered solutions, emphasized safety and said I still wanted to maintain good rapport with one another. Their response? Play the victim and blame my dogs. Then I started getting unhinged texts from the wife about how my message ‚Äúruined her week‚Äù and how ‚Äústressful‚Äù this is for them and how I owed her an apology. üôÑ 

Eventually, they put up a 6‚Äô privacy fence attached to mine (illegal height, but whatever since they now hate me I‚Äôd prefer not seeing them hence why I didn‚Äôt report it to the town). Problem solved, right? Nope. They started letting their dogs off-leash in the unfenced areas. I ended up getting security cameras installed, and thank god I did because I caught everything on video: the same dog trying to break through my fence to attack my dogs, their other 2 running into my garden, and all of them running at large in the street where people walk constantly.

After they started cursing me out when their dog tried attacking mine I got the police involved which infuriated her. The lieutenant himself told me to keep sending every clip and he‚Äôd fine them every single time. He was genuinely concerned about safety in the neighborhood after seeing my footage.

Now for the petty revenge: Tonight, I caught them on camera walking their dog in the wildlife refuge across the street. Dog poops. They don‚Äôt pick it up. My neighborhood has a FB group where people constantly complain about mystery poop. So this time, instead of ignoring it, I sent the video to our community leader. He told me to post it publicly and also asked that I email every resident about their behavior. Done.

Now the entire neighborhood knows they‚Äôre the scumbags who:

-Let their dogs off leash
-Have an aggressive dog trying to attack others
-Don‚Äôt pick up after them

People even commented they‚Äôve stopped walking on our block because they felt unsafe and others said they always wondered who was leaving the piles all over. Even better our community leader also personally went over to shame them and said he‚Äôd bring it up with the cops too (power in numbers baby!)

So tonight, instead of me being frustrated, they got called out publicly, shamed privately, and will likely get fined again soon. And I got to sit back knowing every single word I said was backed by video evidence with no way for them to spin it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n3pqza/neighbors_aggressive_dogs_kept_attacking_mine_so/,-0.9949,0.06144313993970516
"Keep crushing my food, I'll return the favour with interest","Saw another post here that reminded me of this one. TL;DR at the bottom.

The company I worked for at the time had vending machines that were paid for with company cards topped up with a daily allowance with any excess spending being deducted from your salary. The prices were at cost to the business so it was cheap, convenient and free - unless you were greedy.

One of the items in the vending machine was the lovely Kinder Bueno, both milk and white chocolate versions. Me and a colleague (A) would almost always buy these if they were in stock because they're an incredible invention to all of chocolatekind. They are however, VERY fragile and another colleague (R) started making it a habit to crush them in some way whenever we bought them.

R would hammer fist if we left them on the desk, slap it straight out of your hand  while walking and even a slap on the arse if you dared to put it in your back pocket. R figured that because they were basically free that this was fine to do without replacing them etc. A and I both disagreed and told him to stop because it's annoying and technically not free if we keep having to buy replacements but R continued anyway.

On to the MC. One day the vending machines got stocked with massive bags of crisps so we bought a big bag of Quavers and of course our beloved Buenos. R crushed the Buenos, laughed and carried on working like nothing happened. He went for lunch and A had had enough and was genuinely pissed off at this point so he told me his plan. We both opened the Quavers, crushed them into dust and then poured each bag into his jacket pockets which was hanging on the back of his chair and zipped them back up.

End of the day comes around and he shuts down his laptop, puts on his jacket and goes to put his hands in his pockets as we sit there smiling and giggling a bit. At first he thinks the big prank was that we'd zipped up the pockets so he's also smiling as that would be a harmless little inconvenience. Then he puts his hands in his pockets, frowns and then pulls them out to find them absolutely covered in Quaver dust. We erupt in laughter, he asks us what was the reason for doing it and I just said ""Leave our fucking Buenos alone!"". A moment of silence, realisation and them a defeated sigh. ""Truce?"" ""Truce"". The next time we got a Bueno he visibly thought about doing it, then remembered the Qauver incident and pulled himself back. We laugh about it now and it definitely served it's purpose as our Buenos were safe for the next 2 years of working there.

TL;DR - co-worker kept crushing our Kinder Buenos, we crushed 2 massive share bags of Quavers and poured them in his jacket pockets.

EDIT - apparently I need to mention that we are all friends and highlight that these are obviously (at least I thought so) fairly light-hearted pranks. The number of you who sound insufferable as co-workers screaming to report him to HR is honestly astounding. You would genuinely risk ruining a friendship, career and even home life over something as stupid as crushing a chocolate bar? We're not the type of people to take offence to anything - especially things as mundane as this. The slap on the ass is obviously done in jest and somehow people are absolutely reaching by saying he does this to everybody and is a sexual predator?

Slumlord revenge,"I moved to a new state after college for a job, and found a house to rent pretty quickly, landing on one where the landlord said he caters to young professionals moving to the area. (Red flag one. You won‚Äôt know state landlord tenant laws, and he was banking on that) 
So I move into a duplex, it was near downtown and seemed pretty cool. Until I met the upstairs neighbors. They were catty and super loud from day one, while I was quiet and lived alone. Anyways, after a few months they moved out, and the landlord had a maintenance crew basically gutting and updating the place upstairs. This crew was super scummy. I‚Äôd come home from work to find piss on my toilet seat (I‚Äôm a female and it wasn‚Äôt me), which was a frequent occurrence. 

Once, I came home and my underwear drawer was open and all my stuff messed up and unfolded. Another time, I came home and my mail was inside (there was absolutely no need to be touching my mail box, which was separate from the neighbors). That‚Äôs a felony. Anyways, this all was commonplace and the crew would start working before 7am, also illegal in that state based on noise ordinances. 

The week before I started my new job, the boiler broke and it was 90 degrees inside because it wouldn‚Äôt turn off, and was blasting heat in the middle of summer. When I told scumlord I needed to shower, he told me to go next door and ask, because the neighbors were his tenants too. And I didn‚Äôt need to rent a hotel. If I did, he‚Äôd take me to court and refuse to deduct it from the rent while the house was inhospitable. What!?

Anyways, long story short this all continued for months and I felt unsafe at home, my personal items were violated, and there was piss I had to clean up daily. I looked for another place immediately after researching landlord tenant laws and realizing he broke the lease by not being able to provide functional utilities, or a peaceful and habitable environment to live in. I took the fucker to small claims for my entire deposit back and last months rent since I moved out. The whole time, he was threatening to take me to court for breach of lease if I left. Fuck off, asshat. 

I hired a lawyer to make sure I understood my rights, and guess what?? That lawyer was his childhood best friends DAD!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ I couldn‚Äôt have picked better. You don‚Äôt need one to go to small claims but he asked if he could go, and I was like hell yeah! 

We get to court and the judge says something like ‚ÄúI see you here a lot, but not used to seeing you on the other side of it.‚Äù she also seemed amused. Between her and the lawyer, they wiped the floor with that scummy piece of shit, and I was able to show a completely clean house with no damage through photos. (He was trying to keep my security deposit for cleaning the fridge and closets, so I showed the judge photos proving otherwise)

In the end, I was released from the lease because of his breach of contract, got my last months rent, full security deposit plus the $500 pet deposit that was ‚Äúnon-refundable‚Äù ha haaaaa!! 

He refused to pay the settlement within the 30 days he had, so I took the judgement to his bank and was able to threaten him with garnishment if he didn‚Äôt pay up. That worked. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n3a2n1/slumlord_revenge/,0.9359,0.06750671354154757
I've been petty since I was in elementary school.,"I'm GenX and I thought it was silly to classify these generational groups. Because I know some diabolical genZ and I love them for that! However, this involves my father. Back in the day getting corporal punishment was a spanking from your father with a thick leather belt. 

My dad was a vet from Vietnam and a narcissist. A combination that wasn't ideal for a parent.

I think I was in 1st grade so 6 or 7 maybe I was in a higher grade, but still young. 

My little brother the golden child could never get in trouble no matter how much I tried. I was no saint. He was a dick so no regret. 

We road bikes everywhere and all the time. From sun up to sun down. Always looking for strangers giving free candy from their generic white van. My bike was laying in the front yard partly in the driveway because that's where I dropped it when I ran in the house to watch Gilligan's Island and probably the 3 Stooges.

So my pettiness is this. My father comes home from work and runs over my bike. Comes in yelling and ready to give me a whooping. I was about to give in when I saw that he brought home a coworker. That's when I had the greatest of ideas. I started to cry, really wailed and was yelling in-between my sobs ""please daddy don't beat me again"". Then I tried to hide behind a chair near his co-worker. To really sell my performance (and that's what it was, a preference) I started to pee all in my pants. My father's face went white. Like he might lose his job if this guy starts to talk back at work. 

My dad changed gears and went into protective mode.....not mine but his own. Saying for whoever would listen that ""I don't beat you"". 

The guy had to leave right after my Oscar preference. My father just looked at me and asked why I did that? I said I didn't want a spanking. He did NOT spank me. A beating is more like it. I'm kidding he apparently respected my ingenuity or guile. 

I'm sure CPS was a thing back then but nothing ever came of it. My next bike was a real P.O.S though.

"""Don't get your panties in a twist. I'll be gone in 5 minutes anyway.""","The year is 2001. It's 8AM and I'm late to the first class of the day with a professor that hates my guts. The pressure is real and I am getting my student shitbox car out of the underground garage only to find the exit blocked by a black Nissan X-trail. Based on the pristine condition of its paint, the poor thing had most likely never left town and the worse obstacle it had surmounted was the curb it was now proudly blocking...

Out of the vehicle steps out a creature the locals (This is south of France) call a Cagole. For those of you too lazy to look it up, picture bleached blond hair with a solid 5 centimer of dark roots showing, skin so tanned it looks like leather, a wide open mouth full of chewing gum with a Gauloise Coporal cigarette somehow precariously stuck in the corner of her mouth.

Granted, I could have reacted more politely but a combination of stress, sleeplessness and general frustration to the fact that it was the 3rd time in 5 days that somebody had decided to ignore the big underground parking door studded with 3 NO PARKING signs got the better of me and I honked and yelled, asking her to move her car. Now. Please. Thank you.

All I got in return was a finger and the scream ""Don't get your panties in a twist now asshole. I'll be gone in 5 minutes anyway so chill."" before she disappeared in one of the nearby businesses.

5 minutes pass. No sign of the Cagole. 5 more minutes. Nothing. An other 5. Surprisingly enough, still nothing. At this point, I am guaranteed to miss the start of my class and am already looking forward to the stern and condescending scolding of the professor. I am delighted, my mood is improving by leaps and bounds and I resign myself to the obvious: the lady is not coming back any time soon and my only two choices left are either to somehow convince her to move her car or get it towed away.

Since I had not been the most civil during first interaction with her, I decide to mend my way, enter the premises she disappeared in 15 minutes ago and find her sitting cosily with a cup of coffee and an other cigarette doing small talk.

If looks could kill, I would have been reduced to atoms on the spot. She answered my question with a colourful ""Fuck off you little shit, can't you see I'm working here??? Piss off. I'll be done in half an hour anyway so what are you complaining about? Get the fuck out of here.""

She actually did come out 30 minutes later and would have escaped the tow truck had it not been for her 4 fully deflated tyres. So instead she spent 15 minutes working on her tan next to her car before the police removed it and gave her a ticket for illegal parking AND an other ticket for disorderly conduct and disrespect for the police force. It's never a good idea to swear and curse at cops.

Also, to this day, I still wonder if she noticed the potato I squeezed in her exhaust pipe...",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n28hpr/dont_get_your_panties_in_a_twist_ill_be_gone_in_5/,-0.9966,0.0782494875887683
The smallest petty win over a bully,"When I was in high school, one of the tough girls I was friends with suddenly turned on me, and went from being a friend to being my bully. 

Turns out a different girl who was jealous of me told this bully and the rest of the girls in my group that I said they were ‚Äúfucking bitches‚Äù, which wasn‚Äôt true. I hadn‚Äôt said that and I don‚Äôt trash talk my friends. Anyway, that‚Äôs all it took and my now former friends were cornering me in the school hallways, intimidating me, and pushing me around. It finally stopped 2 years later when I fought back but the heartbreak and hurt about the whole unfair thing lingered for years. 

Anyway, I was working cash at a big retailer after graduation when my former bully came in. She saw me, came up to my til, and asked to use the store phone to call a taxi (this is before everyone had cell phones). I said ‚Äúsure‚Äù
And handed her the receiver. She tries to call the taxi and the store‚Äôs automotive desk picked up. She hung up and tried again. The automotive desk picked up.

"The pettiest of petty, but dang it made me laugh (and still does)","I've enjoyed lurking here and hope you will enjoy this fond memory as much as I enjoy remembering it. It was many years ago, but I still laugh when I recall that day.

I was on a highway traveling northbound. The route is divided, two lanes either direction. I  eventually needed to exit right to get eastbound onto the Interstate. A couple or three miles before my exit I found myself behind a real dominguero. This guy was going about 10 under the speed limit. The typical flow of traffic in this area is 5 to 10 over. So I thought I'd get over into the passing lane and get around him quick before I had to exit.

I get in the left lane and he speeds up. So I speed up a little more. And he guns it, so I thought, hey he realized he's going way too slow. I'm not trying to get a speesing ticket out here. So I got back in the right lane and dropped in behind him, now doing about 5 over with several car lengths between us.

But as soon as I got settled back in that lane, he starts slowing down again, and now we're going even slower. Like, 11 or 12 under. So I ease back into the left lane and the SOB guns it again, now doing at least 15 over and I can't pass without a criminal level of speeding. So I let off the gas and let him get ahead.

And that's when I noticed: This jackass has his driver's window ALL THE WAY DOWN. And I knew right then what I was going to do. I eased back in behind him. Predictably, he goes back to turtle speed.

Third time, I get into the left lane and start to pass. He speeds up. And when he lines up so that I am right up next to him, I veered to my right, hugging the striped line as close to him as I can legally be, and I pulled the lever to activate my windshield washer. I held it with mischievous joy, spraying and spraying and spraying. Just as I hoped, it went straight into his open window and soaked him. I got him good. Not just the arm he had propped up on the door. I got him all over the side of his stupid face. He let off the gas, shook his head like a wet dog (pretty sure I got it in his ear) and wiped his face with his hand.

Laughing maniacally, I gunned it, got in front of him, and exited onto the Interstate about a quarter mile later. I laughed and laughed for miles. I laughed until I cried and my cheeks and ribs hurt.

Workplace revenge,"Just seen a post whereby someone was getting annoyed that a co-worker kept leaving early, even though it didn‚Äôt affect them. Made me think of what happened to me some time ago.

Worked in a large office with multiple departments. Each department could choose whether they wanted to have flexi-time or not. Most chose to have this option. The core hours were 10am - 4pm, so everyone needed to be in the office during this time. The phone lines were open from 9am - 5pm. So long as there was phone cover the hour before and the hour after core time, no one minded how people managed their flexi. Living the furthest away, I chose (after making sure it was ok) to come in at 8am everyday and leave at 4pm so that I could avoid the worst of rush hour traffic. I had been working these hours for the better part of 4 years and no one had a problem with it. Until I changed departments.

Despite there always being cover up until 6pm most days (office was open 8am-6pm) my co-workers had a problem with me being the only one leaving a 4. They complained constantly to the department manager. He gave them the option of leaving early if they wanted, setting up a rota of people leaving early, basically any workable solution that was feasibly possible. Nope, nothing was acceptable. None of my co-workers wanted to leave early (unless there was an emergency, drs appointment etc) so if they chose to stay until 5pm, then I should also fit in with the team and do the same. Exhausted, my manager spoke to me and said he‚Äôd tried everything but they just wouldn‚Äôt back down. I asked if I could move to another department that didn‚Äôt mind me leaving at 4 but he gave me a piece of information which made me smile and I decide to stay. I asked if he wouldn‚Äôt mind batting them off for the next couple of weeks because I had a plan.

Team meeting was held after a couple of weeks to discuss working hours and I sat back and allowed my co-workers to get themselves worked up. I decided to throw in a few comments here and there to rile them up some more and when I thought it was the right moment, I held my hands up and conceded defeat. I asked the team if they prefer I work 9-5. They all agreed. Giving a quick look to my manager, I repeated that we should all work the same hours, considering their argument was that I was the only one leaving early. Unanimous agreement. So I suggested that we should all, as a team, work 9-5. Enthusiastic nodding. Starting from tomorrow.

Silence. My manager spoke up saying that was a wonderful idea and was a brilliant solution. He‚Äôd put it in place immediately, so that we could all come off flexi-time and as a department, all work the same hours, which is what the team wanted in the first place.

Now is a good time to mention that there was a worldwide sporting event taking place at the time. Living in the UK but not being British, I didn‚Äôt feel the need to follow the UK teams. The event was being held abroad, so due to time differences, some of the games were played in the morning, UK time, meaning that my co-workers could watch the games and still be in at work by 10am. I piped up to remind my team that this meant I would no longer be the only one covering the phones from 9-10 and phew (yes, they conveniently forgot that they left me to answer the phones for that hour pretty much every day since me starting on the team) what a relief because the phones did get busy first thing in the morning. One colleague tried to speak up but my manager reminded them that this is what they‚Äôve been asking for all along - that the whole team worked the same hours.

Oh yes, this was also the time to mention that seeing as I couldn‚Äôt leave early anymore, there was no need to work through my lunch break (something I offered to placate them and I didn‚Äôt used to have lunch that often back then. Flexi meant that people had the choice to take two hours for lunch and I‚Äôd offered to cover the phones when the games were on) so I‚Äôd stop doing that, otherwise I‚Äôd be worn out working flat out until 5. That meant that the quarter and semi finals they had planned to watch, which so happened to be played over UK lunchtime and our office were showing on the large screen in the main conference room would only have a restricted viewing time of 1 hour now. I announced that I could see I was being selfish for being the only one to leave early and I was pleased to fit in with everyone else by working 9-5. That also meant that I wouldn‚Äôt be signing off the payments from the previous day, something I would do between 8-9 when it was nice and quiet, albeit that I chose not to remind them of that but I did like seeing the look on their faces when they realised they had extra work to do the following morning - work that they should‚Äôve been doing in the first instance (again, something I volunteered to do to try to placate them).

Oh and that information that my manger gave me in our meeting 2 weeks prior? In a cost cutting exercise, my office was relocating to another one which happened to be a lot closer to where I lived, so ultimately the removal of flexi-time worked in my favour as it meant I could then walk to and from work. Oh it was difficult not to pull a smug face when the relocation was announced. 

I think the British term ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt piss on your chips‚Äù definitely applied here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n1uzuf/workplace_revenge/,0.9908,0.05711298480213348
Wanna park like an a-hole? Get trapped like an a-hole.,"I went to the mall yesterday to go to my local Barnes and Noble. This mall‚Äôs Barnes and Noble parking area is like always full, but I found a cute little spot and I parked my happy ass car in it. 

Well once I‚Äôve finished spending a ridiculous amount of money on books I‚Äôll never read I come back to my car only to find that a car had parked next to mine (driver‚Äôs side) so fucking close a child would not be able to squeeze in there. 

I do the old crawl in through passenger side maneuver, very annoyed, and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwell that was fucking annoying, let me just leave‚Äù and then I realize. 
Why should this asshole get the pleasure of entering their car all happily when I did not? 

So I take a gamble, that the car on their driver side will leave before them. I‚Äôm waiting outside, I shit you not, not even 2 minutes later someone‚Äôs happy ass walks out of the Barnes and Noble presumably with books they will never read. He gets into the car next to asshole‚Äôs car and leaves. Happy not reading to you my friend, I love you. 

I get back in my car and pull into the spot so close a child would not be able to fit through it. It took some effort to park that shitty. And I wait again, outside of course. About 15 minutes of Reddit scrolling later someone‚Äôs happy smug ass walks out of the Barnes and Noble and his smugness is instantly crushed when they realize oh no my car is so close to this car that a CHILD COULD NOT FIT THROUGH. I smile. I could do this all day. 

I watch him STRUGGLE to get from the passenger side seat to the driver‚Äôs seat because oh yeah I forgot to mention. This guy is not skinny and he was tall, like at least 5‚Äô11. I am 5‚Äô2 and did the passenger to driver seat gymnastics in under half a minute. This guy struggled for like 3 minutes trying to get his legs to the other side. 

Once I see him almost done with his gymnastics (‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel nice when it happens to you‚Äù is all I‚Äôm thinking) I walk over to my car and get in and reverse out. I make sure to glance at him and smile then give him the finger. He looks bewildered, already enraged about this 3 minutes of struggle. Why would I flip him off? A look of realization crosses his face. I like to think his dumbass just realized that my car was on the other side before. 

Think before parking like an asshole. 

Edit: Since a couple people asked, no he was not in the line. He was over the line. This mall has the type of parking where every spot is like double lined not sure how else to explain, but he was not in EITHER set of lines lolll",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n1lust/wanna_park_like_an_ahole_get_trapped_like_an_ahole/,0.9828,0.07781183912487805
Fun Story from CompUSA,"Back in 2004ish, I used to be the Front End Manager at CompUSA. As the name suggests, they sold computer hardware and software. 

I was over all the cashiers, front end supervisors and door security staff. 

During one of our monthly meetings, the operations manager, Jeff, brought up the fact that I was not having my staff mention all the various things that CompUSA wanted to upsell on. 

This meeting included the store manager (Tim) sales manager, tech manager (Mike) & operations manager (Jeff)

I reminded the group that I was having my staff focus on what I thought they could sell during that particular transaction. There was no need to mention other services that did not apply to that purchase and it made the transactions go faster and smoother.

My best friend and roommate Mike, who was also the tech manager, backed me up, as he used to be the Front end Manager before I took over. Of course, Jeff just kept making me look bad to the group and then the sales manager started blaming me for the lower then expected numbers. The numbers were slightly above target on multiple fronts but some were lower then they wanted on others. Some things were just hard to sell. 

After being the punching bag for a while, I just said ""fine...."" and had a talk with my staff to cover everything they wanted.

The next day, every cashier was offering replacement plans, store credit cards, training classes, in-home installations, & AOL signups for every transaction. Credit Cards & AOL signups required the cashier to walk the customer to another termianl to sign up, taking about 3-5 minutes. 

This caused the lines to check out to slow to a crawl and the sales manager noticed immediately. His staff were stuck waiting in line with customers so they could get credit for the sale and they could not leave laptops and high end hardware with customers before they paid.

That lasted about a week before they told me I could go back to the system I had before. Offer what matched the customer needed with the product they were purchasing.

Now, several months passed and the store manager came up with an incentive program to help increase add-on sales. Staff would get a ""store credit"" for every add-on they sold. We already got a commission for these and this was on top of that, so win-win. 

For example, for every AOL signup, we would get $10 of in-store credit. Replacement plan - $5-20 (depending on price), Credit Card approval $10.  The store manager made up fake currency called ""Tim Bucks"" with his face on it and he signed each one (to prevent fraud).

I had a good staff and I was darm good at selling these too! I spend most of my day on the register already so I just kept making my sales numbers. I did try a ""little"" harder cause who does not want free stuff. 

After about month, I had over $1500 in store credit.
I decided it was time to buy some new hardware for myself and had one awesome gaming setup, for the time.

A week later, I get a call from Mike that corporate security was at the store and Jeff had been accusing me of stealing all this stuff. I got dressed and came into work early.  I was greeted by Mike when I arrived and he filled me in on all the crazy stuff that had been said by Jeff. Mike walked me over to the cash office (my office) where the corporate people were. 

They were pleasant at first but then asked me about all the merchandise I had rang up at $0.00 though the register. I explained that I earned that much in store credit and that I used to purchase the items I wanted. I am guessing the amount I purchased at once and the amount is what flagged it for Jeff when he ran his morning reports. 

Jeff could have asked me about it but, nope, he just assumed that I had stolen it, but that I was dumb enough to ring it through the register system.

So, I am sitting there smirking and Mike knows exactly what I am about to do. I roll over to my filling cabinet and pull out my employee purchase folder. Every employee purchase had to have a copy of the sales receipt kept on file. In my file, is a copy of every receipt with the ""Tim Bucks""  attached to the ones that needed it. 

They took my folder to the store managers office to compare my ""tim bucks"" to the list he had kept of each one he issued.  Twenty minutes latest, they came out and corporate security asked me to come back into the cash office. They said every transaction I did was legit and it was good I had such detailed documentation for every employee purchase.  I knew everything was good but was just in shock I was being accused of theft. 

Well, since corporate was in town anyways, they said they were taking all the managers out for lunch, their treat.  Mike and I were standing on the front end and excited for some free food. Plus, I was not even scheduled to work for 2 more hours so I had the free time to spare. 

Jeff walked up front, kinda not wanting look at me and said ""You can't go, you have to watch the store""

I thought that was horse crap, especially after what had just went down. I was not even scheduled to work yet! Mike thought so too and he knew me well enough to know I was hatching a plan. 

And all the managers came up front, near the exit doors, my rage level went to 100 and I did what I had to do.

I walked Infront of the registers where we had all the top selling PC games.  World of Warcraft, Star Wars Galaxies, Doom 3, Half-Life, ect. I opened my arms wide, scooped up as many as I could. I walked over to the front doors, which had security sensors, and threw all of the boxes into the vestibule.  

I turned towards all the other manager and corporate, who were stunned at what I just did. They were speechless and trying to find words to explain the situation.

I locked eyes with corporate security and said ""PC Games over $50 are required to have anti-theft tags on them. .... I don't think any of those do...."" (Cause the alarm never when off as 30 boxes flew past them on their way to the floor)

I just walked away from the area and could hear Mike laughing his butt off while corporate security was putting 2 and 2 together.

I went out to smoke, while Jeff picked up the games on the floor, and the rest went to lunch, without him  After lunch they did an audit on all the items that did not have security tags. It was Jeff's job to make sure the correct items had those tags. 

Guessing there was more then just those games that were not tagged cause that audit took a few days.

The old parking space scenario!,"Not sure this totally fits with the revenge topic, but here goes.

I was going to grocery store and I see two spots available right next to each other.  This was a score because this particular store doesn't have too many spaces that are close to the entrance due to the weird parking lot footprint.

As I am about to pull in, a woman coming from the other side wants to pull into one of the spots, so I waive her on.  It was no big deal because there were two spots.  After she pulls in, I pull into the other spot on her driver side, right next to her.  

Now, I am a pretty good parker (if that is a word), but after I pull in, she gives me a very dirty look and she gestures to the door or the ground, something I wasnt sure of.  My assumption is that she perceives that there isn't much room for her to get out.  Since I was in a good mood, I back up and move my car over a bit, still staying within the lines. Same reaction from the woman as before but with an added exagerated sigh. Not letting this grump ruin my day or dampen my sparkle, I decide to move the car over another few inches.  

When I get back into the spot.  Not only do I get the dirty look AND the sigh again, she added an eye roll this time.  I get enough of those from the teenagers in my life and my sparkle is in danger if getting dampened.  

What am I to do?  Well, I got out of my car to inspect the placement of the park job.  I am pretty close to the car next to me on my driver's side but there is a person sitting in the passenger seat that was apparently watching this interaction, so I figure they weren't planning on getting out anyway.  When I look on the other side of my car where the grumpy woman was, her car was actually a few centimeters over the line.  She is also craning her head back to see what I am doing.  

I have a decision to make.  So I make it quick.  I get back into my car and at this point she is saying something probably not nice to me and gesturing her hands for me to speed up, I assume.  I tell her to calm down as best I can with hand gestures and I pull my car back out a third time.  

This time I move my car toward her car so I am perfectly in the middle of my spot.  It was never my fault in the first place. I get out, take a picture of both of our cars and her license plate and she winds her window down and rudely ask me where I think I am going.  The passenger in the other car next to me calls out to get my attention as Madam Grump says, ""are you going to answer me, you need to move your car!""  I look at the passenger trying to get my attention and he says, ""fuck that bitch, some people just can't be pleased.""  I look back at Madam Grump, and say, ""what he said"" pointing to the passenger in the other car.

I then proceeded to I walk by him and we high fived and I walked into the store while she sat there like a giant angry turd seething.

Bamboo for you.,"I have a crappy neighbor with a crappy girlfriend who moved into our small and tight-knit neighborhood about 5 years ago. The gf who is about 20 years younger is ok, but he is an absolute nightmare. 

The first few months they were here, their very dangerous dogs kept getting out and chasing neighbors into their homes. They‚Äôve dug under my fence and attacked two of my dogs (both ok). 

You cannot talk to him as he‚Äôs a man who cannot take accountability whatsoever. A realtor reported him for leaving his boat parked at his house and he took it out on all the other neighbors and started reporting everyone for the dumbest shit. 

Well. Now. He started breeding dachshunds. I have a dachshund as well and know they can be ‚Ä¶ stubborn to say the least, but as a responsible owner, I‚Äôve trained him not to bark outside. Inside is fine, because I get it - stuff outside moves, but he‚Äôs very well behaved outside, and if he‚Äôs not, we have a backup e-collar. 

Now, he has decided to let the dachshunds stay outside all day while he‚Äôs at work or when they go out to dinner or something. And the ENTIRE time they are gone - the dog barks. I have a 3 hour long recording of them barking continuously. Animal control will not do a single thing about it because ‚Äúthey have shade and water.‚Äù 

So, ok. They have a pool VERY close to my fence and I‚Äôve heard them complaining about our very old Crape Myrtle that has been there before their pool was there - so I am not removing it. It‚Äôs shade for my dogs, my chickens, and my hanging plants. Not to mention a safe spot for my visiting birds. 

Well. We tried asking him to not keep the dogs outside all day to bark, but he told us to go fuck ourselves, basically. 

So NOW, we have an additional Crape Myrtle set up by the fence with a line of clumping bamboo in the middle. And on a branch on the Crape Myrtle they hate SO much, is a Bluetooth speaker that just plays a lovely ringing sound for them. They haven‚Äôt been able to use their pool in 3 weeks because the ringing is so bad. 

Here‚Äôs where it gets very good. They cannot call the cops or city, because their fence didn‚Äôt have a permit when they put it up, and they KNOW I‚Äôll report it immediately if they try. 
Jerks. 

EDIT: this is a CLUMPING bamboo. The variety I got is very easy to manage. We also put in a rhizome barrier when we planted them. It was well planned out. Thank you for your concern tho!!! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n1jowd/bamboo_for_you/,-0.8856,0.0781096121827136
The Lord of the Ringer,"This is a old story I had not thought of for ages. Not sure why it popped into my head today but I want to document it before it slips away again.

First we have to go back to the wayway before times. When RadioShack was the king of cellphone sales and still actually sold component level electronics. 

I was your typical sales agent. 18, perpetually stoned, and quite helpful for the average customer. My job becomes relevant later. 

Enter ""Dave"". Dave was a regular party crasher in my friends group. I say ""in"" with sarcasm. He was that person everyone has known forever and just kind of tolerated but tried to avoid. Kind of guy that was constantly showing up already plastered and picking a fight with someone smaller. Thankfully once we were all past school age everyone cut him out of thier lives a cancer. What happens below was just before graduation.

We were having a little get together. Just 9 or 10 friends getting drunk together, not a crazy party or anything. Dave shows up and let's himself in as usual. Within 20 minutes he's picking a fight. Tries to sucker punch someone and ends up face planting in the kitchen. As he's going down his new cellphone comes flying out of his pocket. He was way too drunk to even notice so we proceeded to pass the phone around messing with settings. This was one of those phones that was technically an early smart phone but still looked closer to a flip phone, (mechanical keyboard and all). I changed his ringer to the Iconic ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS"", quote; and handed the phone off to the next person.   

I didn't think about it again until two weeks later when Dave storms into RadioShack screaming about how someone at Bell fucked up and owes him an apology. Keep in mind this was the very early days of smart phones and the cost of data was still extremely high. I guess the next person saw what I had changed his ringer to and decided to one up me bigtime. They had found a way to download the high definition LOTR trilogy. Not only had it completely filled the phones memory, but a few weeks later Dave got a bill for 3500$  of data usage. 

The truth is I could have called Bell and gotten the charges removed from the account. It would not have been the first time I had helped someone with a ""accidental download"". Knowing what a perpetual ass Dave had been to pretty much everyone in his life over the last 18 years I declined to assist him and just gave him Bells customer service number. I hope he had to pay every penny. Fuck Dave.

Someone had to pay me hush money so I didn‚Äôt call the cops,"When I lived at home 30 years ago a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù stole my CC, used it and returned it. This was the days before smart phones etc. I was shocked when I got the bill. An older friend kept his ear to the streets and someone slipped up talking about their new car amp and scanner. I honed in on them, suddenly they didn‚Äôt wanna hang out anymore. Called the managers of the stores, they agreed to fax me the CC receipts. When the cc receipts came in I noticed the first dimwit actually signed his name. I own them, proof of the crime. The CC companies were lax local police didn‚Äôt care, wouldn‚Äôt even take a report, so now I can do what I want. I phoned dude, recorded it, and made him an offer he couldn‚Äôt refuse. If he refused I‚Äôd tell everyone that you and so and so are thieves and the next place I was going was your job and your name will be in the local paper. My demands were simple, give me the items back, which I returned for credit and pay me one thousand dollars cash and I won‚Äôt call the cops and from here on out pretend like you don‚Äôt know me. He took the offer, it worked. I still told everyone don‚Äôt invite Rick and Karl into your house, they‚Äôre thieves. 

The reason I told this story was I saw another story about someone flattening car tires on video cuz someone parked next them and didn‚Äôt like. Rich dad bailed his kid out. Sure, you could get em in court but why not shake them down for some hush money to keep their ass outta jail or having a record? If you hold all the cards don‚Äôt sign an NDA in exchange for the money.  

EDIT: My buddy John is the real hero in all of this, and older dude w common sense he was the OG sleuth. When an older dude speaks, you listen. Wish his GF/wife didn‚Äôt hate me but I haven‚Äôt seen him in 30 years, we used to blast our car stereos and detail our cars every Saturday during the summer.
